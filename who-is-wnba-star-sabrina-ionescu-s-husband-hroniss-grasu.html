Here’s more on her contest with Curry and why you might recognize her husband Hroniss Grasu.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-4_53>In July 2023, Ionescu won the WNBA 3-Point Contest breaking a record for both leagues with a 37-point final round, making 25 of 27 3-pointers, including 20 consecutive, and Curry was impressed. The Warriors guard and two-time NBA 3-Point Contest winner took to X posting, “Ridiculous,” to which Ionescu responded, “Shoot out?”</p><p id=par-5_6>And her challenge was accepted.</p><p id=par-6_82>Prior to the Stephen vs. Sabrina 3-Point Challenge Ionescu told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Today</a>: “It’s not like I’m joining the NBA’s 3-point contest. But we’re really having our own and the significance and importance of that and kind of just having that idea stem from a joke and now being able to see it come to life and knowing that it’s going to be a great experience for us both and exciting to see what it’s going to mean for basketball as a whole.”</p><p id=par-7_89>Curry added: “Watching what she did at All-Star weekend, watching what the WNBA season was like, how it’s continuing to grow and then understanding there’s a nice connection here that’s an authentic competition between two great shooters who’ve had success in a 3-point contest. And now you’re trying to level the playing field … ‘This is the dopest thing in the world, it’s his first of its kind, and it’ll be something that changes the narrative on what it looks like.’ … It’s just competing. Whatever the format is.”</p><p id=par-8_16>Curry ended up winning their shootout by three buckets with his 29 to Ionesue’s 26.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-ionescu-married-to-and-why-nfl-fans-might-recognize-him>Who is Ionescu married to and why NFL fans might recognize him?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-9_34>Ionescu is married to Hroniss Grasu.

She revealed the details of his proposal on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> sharing that she thought she was going to a GQ photoshoot.</p><p id=par-12_55>“I was completely shocked and caught off guard because he played it off so well,” Ionescu said adding that they were joined that evening by friends and family who showed up in a party bus to celebrate with them. She gushed: “I couldn’t stop taking pictures with my ring. This night was just so special.”</p><p id=par-13_43>The pair tied the knot on March 10, 2024, in Laguna Beach, California.
