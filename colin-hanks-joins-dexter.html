Word is that <strong>Colin Hanks</strong>, son of Oscar-winning actor <strong>Tom Hanks</strong>, has joined the popular <a href=#>Showtime</a> series as the season’s main villain.

But then again that’s the beauty of all the antagonists of <strong>Dexter</strong>.<strong> John Lithgow </strong>and<strong> Jimmy Smits</strong> both had previous screen personas that didn’t naturally lend themselves to evil, yet they were performed so brilliantly. Of course the details of the character are being kept tightly under lock and key, so no major details so far.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>I don’t see why Hanks shouldn’t fit in. He is a good actor, perhaps most known for his role in <strong><a href=#>Peter Jackson</a></strong>‘s <strong>King Kong</strong> remake but was more recently seen as a guest character on <strong><a href=#>Mad Men</a></strong>. We’ll keep you posted on more development with Season 6 of <strong>Dexter</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yku8uipWagkaO4tHnJqKCnq12ZsrnAxKtm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessica-mendoza-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jessica Mendoza Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
