<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Why Lorelai Not Wearing An Engagement Ring In The 'Gilmore Girls' Revial Photos Makes Sense</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The newest <i>Gilmore Girls</i> set photos have been released from Netflix's vault, which means it's time to start analyzing every detail of them. First up on the list of "things to scrutinize" before the premiere happens is something that most fans been pondering since the first revival photo hit the web — <a href=# class=T3D>the engagement status of one Lorelai Gilmore and Luke Danes</a>. As in, is Lorelai wearing a ring? You know, a round band, usually in metal with a diamond somewhere in the mix, worn as an ornamental way to say "I am legally bound to another person"? Well, whaddya know, despite the incessant rumors that <a href=# class=T3D>Lorelai Gilmore and Luke Danes may be engaged during the <i>Gilmore Girls</i> revival</a>, Lorelai's ring finger remains unadorned. This is, at least, according to the new photos. But, you Lorelai and Luke iconoclasts (all three of you), this doesn't mean what you might think it means.<a href=# class=T3D> Lorelai not wearing an engagement makes perfect sense</a> and does not discredit the theory that she will be Luke's fiancée in the revival. Because last time the couple was engaged, no one had a ring either.</p><p>I have six words for you: "A House is Not A Home." That's Season 5, Episode 22 of <i>Gilmore Girls, </i>otherwise known as the episode in which Lorelai proposes to Luke. Also otherwise known as the episode that's most emblematic of the way Lorelai and Luke do things: Unconventionally. (Well, Lorelai does most things unconventionally, but oy with the poodles already, amiright?) The best part about "A House is Not A Home," besides everything, was that Luke-table-for-one-Danes and Lorelai-I'm-sorry-can-I-get-an-industrial-forklift-for-my-emotional-baggage-Gilmore got engaged, <i>without</i> a ring. (Side note: Luke does eventually try to pick out a ring for Lorelai, but he runs into some issues with it that involve Kirk and Lulu and this isn't the point. The point is, the ring isn't present right away. Because Lorelai and Luke doing the traditional "ring" thing wasn't ever really their style.)</p><p></p><p>Now, let's take this a step further. After Lorelai and Luke have their "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Marry me Luke! Now or never!</a>" moment, and Lorelai sleeps with and then marries Christopher, the two finally end up back together in the end. Luke solidifies their reunion with a shiny new piece of jewelry. But, not a ring. Ha! A necklace.</p><p>In the final scene of the series, which happens at Luke's diner of course, Rory notices that Lorelai's wearing a new necklace. She says "Hey, I like your necklace. Suits you." Lorelai looks behind her at Luke and smiles, coyly. In this moment, that necklace means everything. It means that Lorelai and Luke get a new start, without all the pressures that had previously plagued their relationship. It means they get to do things differently this time. And if Lorelai and Luke are to get engaged again during the revival (<a href=# class=T3D>as I believe they already have, or will during</a>), that necklace — a symbol of the new Luke and Lorelai — might resurface. Calling it now. Her engagement ring is hanging on a necklace. <i>That</i> necklace.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Or, you know, there's no engagement and Lorelai could quit her job to form an all-girl band with Rory, and Lane. You know, like Bananarama. They could call it Tangerinarama or Banana-fana-fo-fana-rama…or something. Either way, we'll find out soon enough.</p><p><i>Images: Saeed Adyani/Netflix; Warner Bros.
