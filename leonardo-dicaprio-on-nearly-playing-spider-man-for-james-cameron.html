However, seeing as Cameron’s Spider-Man movie sounded so offbeat and weird, there’s a chance that it would have been a massive flop along the lines of Batman and Robin, so it’s certainly possible&nbsp;that it wouldn’t have done his career many favours had that been the case.</p><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=109 data-injectable=false>Tell us, do you wish DiCaprio had played <strong>Spider-Man</strong>?
