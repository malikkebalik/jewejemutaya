The extraordinary efforts of filmmakers have reignited the magic of the big screen, reminding everyone of the unparalleled allures of the theatrical experience. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">As we enter the final months of 2023</a>, it’s time to evaluate the numerous releases this year has bestowed upon audiences.</p>Recommended Videos<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=475 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>Boasting an eclectic blend of highly anticipated sequels, trailblazing originals, and cherished classics reimagined for a new era, 2023 has unfolded as a spectacular year for cinema. This year’s cinematic landscape has showcased an impressive diversity, from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">technologically enhanced animated marvels</a> to emotionally charged, dialogue-driven narratives. Here are the top 10 movies of 2023, ranked according to their global box office earnings (data via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Box Office Mojo</a>).</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=h-10-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania data-injectable=false>10. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=469 data-current-count=769 data-injectable=true>Despite a higher opening than the two preceding Ant-Man films, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</a> ended up cashing in less than its peers after its entire theatrical run. The Paul Rudd-led superhero flick <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">could not impress the audience</a> with Ant-Man’s face-off against&nbsp;Kang the Conqueror, and ended up comparable to Disney’s pandemic-era Marvel movies. However, the $476 million worldwide gross still earned the film a place among the highest-grossing films of 2023.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>9. Elemental</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=548 data-current-count=848 data-injectable=true>From being labeled a box-office bomb to securing the ninth place among 2023’s highest-grossing films, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elemental</a> has sealed its name as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a miraculous sleeper hit</a>. Pixar’s experimental animated romantic comedy has crossed $480 million worldwide, despite opening below projections. The cinematic forces of nature worked their magic and conspired in favor of this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">touching love story between water and fire elements</a>. The film’s final box-office figures have justified the five-minute standing ovation it received at the&nbsp;76th Cannes Film Festival.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>8. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=571 data-current-count=871 data-injectable=true>Tom Cruise’s seventh outing in the Mission: Impossible&nbsp;film series faced <a href=#>tough competition after Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer captured all IMAX theaters</a>. However, the film still managed to have a successful run and crossed the half-a-billion mark. Ethan Hunt’s high-stakes face-off against the Entity earned a positive reception from fans and critics alike, who lauded it as a pinnacle of Hollywood action filmmaking. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One</a> added $563 million to the franchise’s gross and helped it officially hit the $4 billion mark.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>7. The Little Mermaid</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=574 data-current-count=874 data-injectable=true>Disney’s yet-another-live-action experiment <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Little Mermaid</a> proved to be a departure from a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">string of underperforming remakes</a> in recent years. Though it was the second-most-expensive&nbsp;readaptation to date, The Little Mermaid ended up in seventh place as far as this year’s box office winners go. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">innovative and revolutionary approach</a> to the original fairy tale garnered attention and praise, but the visual effects and character designs fell short of impressing critics. The Little Mermaid finished up its theatrical run with a $569 million worldwide earning.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>6. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=485 data-current-count=785 data-injectable=true>Sony Pictures achieved a milestone with the release of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</a>, as the animated masterpiece soared past Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation to claim the title of the highest-grossing animated film distributed by the studio. The film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">opened to unmatched critical success</a> and amassed $689 million worldwide despite <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">facing bans in several countries</a>. It also led the Spider-Man franchise to $10 billion gross, making it the third film franchise to ever do so.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>5. Fast X</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=497 data-current-count=797 data-injectable=true>2023 saw the release of numerous sequel films, paving the way for<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> more to come next year</a>. The crown for highest-grossing non-superhero action film this year went to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the 10th main installment in the Fast & Furious franchise</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast X</a>. Led by Vin Diesel, this high-octane thrill ride revved its way to a staggering $704 million worldwide on an estimated production budget of $340&nbsp;million. The success of Fast X also made Fast & Furious the seventh film franchise&nbsp;to gross $7 billion.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>4. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=448 data-current-count=748 data-injectable=true>MCU’s beloved rag-tag family said their goodbyes to global audiences with a blast, earning a staggering $845 million worldwide. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</a> marked the third and final installment in James Gunn’s superhero trilogy and followed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Guardians’ final battle with the High Evolutionary</a>. The film received praise for shedding light on animal rights issues while also keeping up with Marvel’s hallmark action and comedy.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>3. Oppenheimer</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=497 data-current-count=797 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oppenheimer</a> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">might have lost the Barbenheimer war</a>, but it has still outdone all of Christopher Nolan’s previous features in over 50 overseas markets. Bringing in a total of $890 million worldwide, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">J. Robert Oppenheimer’s biographical epic</a> defeated James Gunn’s superhero flick at the box office substantially. It has also etched its name in history as the highest-grossing&nbsp;World War II&nbsp;film of all time, while also sitting right behind 2018’s Bohemian Rhapsody&nbsp;under the biopic category.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>2. The Super Mario Bros. Movie</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=521 data-current-count=821 data-injectable=true>The first <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">film based on a video game</a> to gross $1 billion worldwide, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a> stood tall as the year’s highest-grossing film before the theaters were painted all pink. The Italian-American plumbers’ alternate world travel earned $1.36 billion worldwide, earning it the number two spot in the top 10. Setting a record-high earning for Illumination Studio, Mario&nbsp;and&nbsp;Luigi’s adventure in the Mushroom Kingdom also broke the record for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-grossing opening&nbsp;for an&nbsp;animated film worldwide</a>.</p><h2 class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-injectable=false>1. Barbie</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-characters=507 data-current-count=807 data-injectable=false>The year’s biggest hit so far, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Greta Gerwig’s</a> proudly feminist <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbie</a> movie is ruling over the 2023 box office, amassing a staggering worldwide gross of $1.40 billion.
