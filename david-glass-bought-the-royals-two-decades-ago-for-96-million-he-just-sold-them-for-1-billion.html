He Just Sold Them For $1 Billion!</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Kansas City Royals haven't had a winning season since their World Series championship in 2015. That hasn't stopped them from increasing in value, though. As a result, their former owner is going out as a winner.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400><a href=# rel=noopener>David Glass</a>, the former CEO and president of Walmart, just sold the Royals for $1 billion. He bought the Royals for $96 million back in 2000. That's a return of more than 941 percent!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Glass sold the team to John Sherman, a Kansas City businessman and former minority owner of the Cleveland Indians. Major League Baseball owners unanimously approved the sale earlier this month.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Glass, 84, spent 20 seasons as owner and CEO of the Royals. He was named interim chairman and CEO after Ewing Kauffman, the team's first owner, died in 1993. The Glass family acquired the Royals from Koffman's estate seven years later.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-290159 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-495741502.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-290159 class=wp-caption-text>Al Bello/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Under Glass's ownership, the Royals had six seasons with 100 or more losses. But they also saw success in the middle of this decade, reaching the 2014 World Series and winning the following year.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sherman had to sell his stake in the Indians to purchase the Royals. Will he be able to use his intel from an AL Central rival to help turn the Royals' fortunes around? That might be too much of a stretch, but according to MLB commissioner <a href=# title="Rob Manfred Net Worth">Rob Manfred</a>, Sherman's time as minority owner gave him a unique advantage.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>"The Indians are regarded to be a very well run and obviously very competitive on the field organization," Manfred said during the MLB Owners Meetings in Arlington, TX. "I think the opportunity to function inside a quality major-league organization gives John a unique opportunity to take over in Kansas City and not miss a step, and continue the historic success that franchise has had."</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The 64-year-old Sherman has founded two energy companies. LPG Services, his first, merged with regional electrical company Dynegy.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Inergy, Sherman's second endeavor, was created in 1996. The propane firm merged with Crestwood Midstream Partners in 2013. Sherman sits on the board of directors for both Crestwood Equity Partners, with the firm earning almost $4 billion in revenue last year.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Glass, he'll retire with a hefty chunk of change. Not a bad way to leave the game!</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjp2Yr6GUYrStrdKsZJunpZy1tXnToZxmqp%2Burq2%2FjK2uqGWUmrCisMSsZJqfn2KzsL6Mcm1mpZmhuaq7zWafnmWaqsC1edKoo51lpJ2yrnnFqKlmaV2Xtq24yKilaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-has-the-higher-net-worth-sofia-richie-or-scott-disick.html><span>←</span><span>Who Has the Higher Net Worth, Sofia Richie or Scott Disick?</span></a>
