<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>These 8 College Football Strength And Conditioning Coaches Are Making More Money Than You Can Imagin</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The strength and conditioning (S&C) coach wasn't even a position on a college football coaching staff until the late 60s. The first one was hired by Nebraska in 1969, and Boyd Epley's $2 per hour compensation was little more than minimum wage (which at the time was $1.30).</p><p>These days, it is one of the highest-paying jobs on a team, sometimes at the same level as the offensive and defensive coordinator.</p><p>This may leave you asking: why the rapid change?</p><p>First of all, salaries for college coaches are skyrocketing across the board, as universities are making larger and larger profits from the relationship between their athletic programs and the media. Secondly, as college games are becoming faster and more physically demanding because of the no-huddle offense, a team's strength and conditioning activities are more important than ever.</p><p>Often, the S&C coach has the best relationship with the players, over anyone else on the staff, due to the significant amount of "face time" they get with team members. Even in the off-season, when the film room is shut down, the work in the weight room never stops.</p><p>All of these factors, when combined, have resulted in enormous salaries for the nation's top strength and conditioning coaches. Here are the top eight, in order of their 2015 base salaries:</p><li><b>Chris Doyle, Iowa – Salary: $515,000</b><p>To give an idea how much this position has grown in value, consider the fact that Doyle made about $185,000 just ten years ago. In other words, in one decade Doyle has experienced a 278% pay increase for the same job on the same team. Doyle's program centers on the "Break the Rock" motto, which is all about tenacity and perseverance. The 17 year Iowa veteran is likely to get a raise this year after helping Iowa reach the Rose Bowl last season (though maybe a few extra reps would have saved them from getting blown out by Stanford).</p></li><li><b>Mickey Marotti, Ohio State – Salary: $431,558</b><p>Head Coach <a href=# title="Urban Meyer Net Worth">Urban Meyer</a> and S&C Coach Marotti seem to be a football match made in heaven. Together they amassed two national titles at Florida, and when Meyer was signed by the Buckeyes, he knew he had to bring his Marotti with him. Together, they've already taken the Buckeyes to one national championship, and they're hungry for more. Last year with bonuses, Marotti pocketed well over $500k.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GettyImages-500102318.jpg alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images" width=900 height=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>(Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)</li><li><b>Scott Cochran, Alabama – Salary: $420,000</b><p>Cochran has garnered a lot of media attention lately after <a href=# title="Kirby Smart Net Worth">Kirby Smart</a>, who was the defensive coordinator for Alabama and is now the head coach at Georgia, tried to sign him with the Bulldogs. This resulted in a bidding war, which ultimately ended in Cochran remaining with the Crimson Tide and receiving a significant raise. Next year, he will likely top this list at over $600,000. Cochran oversees a 37,000 square foot training facility, one of the largest and best in the country. This past season, the Tide won its fourth National Championship in just nine years underneath head coach <a href=# title="Nick Saban Net Worth">Nick Saban</a> and Cochran, proving yet again, that they are a killer combo.</p></li><li><strong>Rob Glass, Oklahoma State – Salary: $401,166</strong><p>Glass graduated from Oklahoma State in 1984, and worked as a strength coach for them after graduating. He's been in the business now for over 30 years. He was an assistant strength coach when <a href=# title="Barry Sanders Net Worth">Barry Sanders</a> played for them back in the 80s, then he left in 1995 to help the Gators bulk up for a decade before returning to his alma mater. "Body by Glass" has been on staff for Oklahoma State since 2005. Besides Barry Sanders, he has been the S&C coach for <a href=# title="Dez Bryant Net Worth">Dez Bryant</a>, Jason Gildon, <a href=# title="Thurman Thomas Net Worth">Thurman Thomas</a>, and <a href=# title="Jevon Kearse Net Worth">Jevon Kearse</a>, just to name a few.</p></li><li><b>Paul Jackson, Ole Miss – Salary: $375,000</b><p>Jackson has only been out of college for ten years. He is the one of the youngest coaches in the country in his position, and his youth, energy, and honesty have made him a hit on social media. He worked under Tommy Moffit (scroll down to number 8) at LSU for a few years, and now the apprentice has outshined the master (at least as far as salary is concerned). A quote from his Twitter feed (@CoachPJackson) says it all: "Achievement is only possible if your outer goals become inner commitments."</p></li><li><b>Ben Herbert, Arkansas – Salary: $340,000</b><p>In 2014, Herbert's first season working for the Razorbacks, Arkansas had the largest offensive line in football – college or otherwise. This was partly due to the demanding motivation displayed by Ben Herbert. That year, this team was the only team in the country with multiple 1,000 yard running backs. He has been in the S&C Business for over a decade, mostly in Wisconsin, and his ability to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of his individual players will likely lead to continued success down south.</p></li><li><b>Pat Moorer, Texas – Salary: $330,000</b><p>Don't underestimate this guy. He won't like it. As a freshman at the University of Florida, he walked on as a linebacker and ended up being the SEC defensive freshman of the year. He brings this same level of pride into the Longhorns' training facility. Moorer came from Louisville with head coach <a href=# title="Charlie Strong Net Worth">Charlie Strong</a>, taking over for long-time S&C coach Jeff Madden. It's a tough legacy to follow, but Moorer seems up to the task.</p></li><li><b>Tommy Moffit, LSU – Salary: $315,000</b><p>Have you ever seen Odell Beckham, Jr. run? Or jump (more like fly)? Part of the credit goes to Mr. Moffit. The SEC is known for its strength and toughness, and Moffit has been producing some of the toughest players in the country for LSU since 2000. LSU boasts one of the best training facilities in the nation, and arguably one of the best strength coaches, in this guy.</p></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2fnquVYoVur86lo56flWKzsLvTm5ilpF2owbOxzaCroWWRo7Fur86nm6KsmaS7qrrGZpqomZOdsrR5wKucZqWRoLavs4ympqudXaK8r7HYZquhmZ5ixrDBjJyYp2WZoq6otc2eZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lil-lotus-s-girlfriend-who-is-lil-lotus-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Lil Lotuss Girlfriend: Who is Lil Lotus Dating?</span></a>
