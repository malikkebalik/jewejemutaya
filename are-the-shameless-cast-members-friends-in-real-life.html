After working together for 10 years, fans think that the cast must be close. However, lead actor <a href=#>Emmy Rossum</a>, who portrayed Fiona Gallagher, left after season nine. Was there a falling out behind the scenes that caused her departure? Fans want to know if the&nbsp;Shameless&nbsp;cast members are friends in real life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Shameless-cast-members.jpg><h2 id=h-the-shameless-cast-grew-up-together-on-set-as-friends><strong>The ‘Shameless’ cast grew up together on set</strong> as friends</h2><p id=par-2_39>Many of the&nbsp;Shameless&nbsp;cast members were very young when they started shooting the series. However, they were lucky to have each other. Actor <a href=#>Emma Kenney</a>, who portrays Debbie Gallagher, called her co-stars her second family in a 2017 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmopolitan</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_11>“We all look out for each other,” she told the outlet.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_47>Kenney described a time when she was writing inappropriate tweets on Twitter. She recalls that Rossum and Shanola Hampton, who portrays V, set her straight. Kenney was nine when she started filming, while her co-star, Ethan Cutkosky (<a href=#>Carl Gallagher</a>), was 12. The two were besties on set.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_31>The older&nbsp;Shameless&nbsp;cast members were also friends early on. Rossum shared in a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>&nbsp;post that Hampton, Jeremy Allen White (Lip), William H.

However, there were no hard feelings, and she didn’t leave because of conflicts behind the scenes. Rossum felt that&nbsp;Shameless&nbsp;gave her wings to grow creatively and pursue variety in her acting career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Shameless-Emmy-Rossum.jpg><p id=par-7_61>“This kind of stability, this family, has nurtured me and made me feel safe enough to stretch and grow creatively,” she wrote to fans on Facebook. “The way [executive producer and showrunner] John Wells has shepherded me as an actress, and more recently how he’s encouraged me wholeheartedly as a director and a writer, has been an honor and a privilege.”</p><p id=par-8_12>The cast revealed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>&nbsp;that they were very sad to see Rossum go.</p><p id=par-9_16>“I was completely behind her decisions, but I’m going to miss her,” Macy told the outlet.</p><h2 id=h-is-the-shameless-cast-still-close-friends><strong>Is the ‘Shameless’ cast still close friends?</strong></h2><p id=par-10_37>Although the&nbsp;Shameless&nbsp;cast felt the departure of Rossum, they pressed on without her. Hampton frequently posts pictures of her with the rest of the cast spending time together. They have remained close friends throughout the 11 seasons of&nbsp;Shameless.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-11_17>“That Friday night shooting life!!
