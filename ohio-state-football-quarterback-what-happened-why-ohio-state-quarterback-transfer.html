The game, which was supposed to showcase Devin Brown’s talent, took an unexpected turn as he limped around with a high-ankle sprain, sidelining him for the rest of the match.</p><p>The Buckeyes, known for their high-powered offenses under coach Ryan Day, were unable to muster their usual performance. Missing star receiver Marvin Harrison Jr., Ohio State scored only three points, marking its lowest output since the College Football Playoff shutout by Clemson in 2016.</p><h2 id=why-ohio-state-quarterback-transfer class="rb-heading-index-1 wp-block-heading">Why Ohio State Quarterback Transfer?</h2><p>The setback in the Cotton Bowl had its roots in the transfer of Kyle McCord, who entered the transfer portal on December 4th.

Kienholz found himself thrust into a challenging situation that ultimately led to Ohio State’s 14-3 loss to Missouri.</p><p>Ohio State’s disappointment was compounded by Missouri’s celebration of their Cotton Bowl victory. This win marked Missouri’s first bowl victory against an AP top-10 team since the 1961 Orange Bowl, highlighting the magnitude of the upset.</p><h2 id=ohio-state-quarterback-transfer-portal class="rb-heading-index-3 wp-block-heading">Ohio State Quarterback Transfer Portal</h2><p>The fallout from the Cotton Bowl has left Ohio State and its fans questioning what went wrong. The combination of Kyle McCord’s departure, Devin Brown’s untimely injury, and the absence of key players like Marvin Harrison Jr. culminated in a disappointing performance that deviated from the Buckeyes’ typical high-scoring games.</p><p>As the team reflects on this unexpected turn of events, there will undoubtedly be discussions about how to address the quarterback situation moving forward. The transfer portal looms large in college football, and Ohio State will need to navigate its challenges to ensure a more stable and successful future.</p><p>In the wake of the Cotton Bowl defeat, the Buckeyes and their supporters eagerly await updates on Kyle McCord’s next steps and the recovery process for Devin Brown.
