Turning 40 next year, the actress maintains a youthful glow by sticking to a clean diet plan. “I drink lots of water and don’t have any real vices. I love green smoothies (specifically spinach and apple),” Lawson said. “I’m a fan of greek yogurt, and I use liquid stevia for my sweetener. I don’t take supplements, I prefer to get my vitamins and stuff from real food sources,” she added.</p><h3 class=related_post_title>Related Posts</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span> <span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwKrGxKxlnKedZK%2Bqrc2cmGakkazAsLqMnaCerF2luaK6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-to-watch-if-you-love-the-band.html><span>←</span><span>What to Watch if You Love the Band</span></a>
