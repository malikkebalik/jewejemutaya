Beginning after Ghost‚Äôs death in <a href=#>Power</a>, the series follows him as he leaves New York City behind for good and settles in Chicago. Tommy‚Äôs rebuilding the business from the ground up and assembling a crew to help make his vision a reality.</p><p id=par-2_44>Though there are mostly new faces on the show, <a href=#>cameos and crossovers</a> are expected. Rumors of an appearance by Francis ‚Äú2-Bit‚Äù Johnson gained steam during the week of March 6, when an actor on the show made a cryptic post on social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2Bit-Power-Michael-Ferguson.jpg><h2 id=h-an-actor-on-power-book-iv-force-made-a-post-that-has-fans-convinced-2-bit-will-be-on-the-show>An actor on ‚ÄòPower Book IV: Force‚Äô made a post that has fans convinced 2-Bit will be on the show</h2><p id=par-3_63>The speculation started after actor <a href=#>Michael J. Ferguson</a> (2-Bit) shared a photo on his Instagram Story with Paulina Nguyen, who appears on Force as Mai Liet. ‚ÄúReal [N-words] never die,‚Äù he captioned the post, which Nguyen reposted on her page. The image is still available on Ferguson‚Äôs Instagram Story at the time of this writing and was also shared on the website <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>.</p><p id=par-4_55>When a fan asked Nguyen what the photo meant after she shared it on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, she wrote back: ‚ÄúI guess we will find out soon‚Ä¶. üòâ‚Äù Some also noted that Ferguson‚Äôs name appears in the cast credits for the show on IMDb. However, that information is not always reliable because anyone can update it.</p><p id=par-5_18>Nonetheless, people are convinced that 2-Bit is about to show up and team up with Tommy once again.</p><p id=par-6_16>‚ÄúAyye Tommy & 2bit back together.

In need of money, 2-Bit went to Tariq St. Patrick (Michael Rainey Jr.) to collect on a debt owed to him by Ghost (Omari Hardwick). Tariq eventually came up with the cash and mentioned in passing in Power Book II: Ghost Season 2 that he doesn‚Äôt expect to see him again. 2-Bit‚Äôs current whereabouts remain unknown.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>Stay tuned to ‚ÄòPower Book IV: Force‚Äô</h2><p id=par-10_41>Only time will tell whether 2-Bit shows up on Power Book IV: Force, but we really hope he will. In the meantime, fans can check out the show now on Starz. New episodes air at 8 p.m. ET on Sundays.</p><p id=par-11_36>The season will seemingly be followed by the second season of the Kanan Stark prequel Power Book III: Raising Kanan, which appears to be in the final stages of production. <a href=#>Read more about that show here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9sMPEq2Sbp5%2BgeqrCjJ%2Bmq5uVYn9ursitZJqooJqus63NnJxmoJmjwaawjJqaraeiY7W1ucto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./drake-bell-says-there-wasn-t-a-huge-payday-from-nickelodeon.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Drake Bell Says There Wasn't a 'Huge Payday' From Nickelodeon</span></a>
