The Nintendo Switch feels like the move Nintendo should have made five years ago. You‚Äôre going to hear that a lot, mostly because it‚Äôs true, or at least feels true off initial impressions less than two months from launch.
There‚Äôs reason to be skeptical, of course. Start with Wii U, Nintendo‚Äôs worst-selling console if you‚Äôre not counting the 1977 Japan-only Color TV-Game.

Come And Find Me&nbsp;endears in a very Charlie Countryman kind of way (if Shia‚Äôs flick was your thing), where love&nbsp;motivates a regular Joe&nbsp;to throw himself to the proverbial lions. Think Mr. And Mrs. Smith, except only the wife is an assassin, and the husband is nothing but urban camouflage (aka cover). Writer/Director&nbsp;Zack Whedon never loses the reality that his graphic-designing hero is in completely over his head, and makes a better thriller for it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Much Is Tori Spelling Worth?
