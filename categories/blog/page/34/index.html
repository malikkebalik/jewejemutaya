The very first time the words "YouTube star" were used on CelebrityNetWorth to describe someone's profession was July 19, 2011. I'm absolutely certain that I scoffed as those words were were typed. Without a doubt in my head (at the time), no one would ever make a living from YouTube, let alone become rich. Honestly, if you told me back in 2011 that within just a few years some of the world's biggest and highest-paid stars would be earning their fame and fortune exclusively through YouTube, I would have laughed you out of the room.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Kerry Livgren Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</h2><time>Aug 8, 2024</time>

Ask fans of Justified about the show‚Äôs current fifth season and they‚Äôre likely to hem and haw before ultimately confessing that it isn‚Äôt the show‚Äôs finest. It‚Äôs hardly an insult. After all, Justified has been one of television‚Äôs best dramas since it debuted in the spring of 2010.
