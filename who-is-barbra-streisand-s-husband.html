With a name synonymous with excellence in the world of musical theatre, we’ve seen her create the icon that is Fanny Brice in Funny Girl — and as much as we love Lea Michele, Barbra is just irreplaceable. With a career as longstanding as hers, it’s no surprise that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she has had her fair share of love stories</a>, each more spellbinding than her last.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>However, she has only taken the walk down the aisle twice, ultimately finding her soulmate on the second attempt. Naturally, someone of Barbra’s caliber <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">could only settle down with individuals as talented as her</a> and of course, someone who would never rain on her parade. So, if you’ve ever wondered who managed to tug at the heartstrings of the one and only Streisand, keep reading.</p><h2 id=h-is-barbra-streisand-married data-injectable=false>Is Barbra Streisand married?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Barbra-Streisand-Yentl.jpg><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>Barbra Streisand has been married to James Brolin since 1998. In case you’ve been living under a rock, yes, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I’m talking about James Brolin from Westworld</a>, Castle, Lightyear, and Stuart Rosenberg’s The Amityville Horror. The duo exchanged vows 25 years ago, marking Streisand’s second marriage and Brolin’s third. Though they didn’t have children together, they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">both had kids from previous marriages.</a></p><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>Brolin is two years older than Streisand, and the couple’s paths crossed in 1996 through a mutual friend. “We were set up on a blind date,” Streisand revealed on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Tonight Show,</a> “and I was so shy that I came into the house and I went downstairs to be with the children and play with them until I had to sit down at the table.” Their immediate connection blossomed into romance two years later when they decided to tie the knot.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>The couple immediately knew it was love for life because, during his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wedding vows</a>, Brolin swayed fans with the words, “I can’t tell you how lucky I am that this would happen to me so late in life. Every night is a new adventure. Sleeping is a waste of time. I can’t wait to see her again in the morning.” Ladies, do not settle for less.</p><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=851 data-injectable=true>Before marrying Brolin, however, Barbra was married to Elliot Gould from 1963 until 1971. Despite being separated for two years before their divorce, the duo remains amicable, sharing one son — the actor Jason Gould. However, between Streisand’s two marriages, the Broadway icon was romantically linked to several other high-profile celebrities and even politicians, including the 15th Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and actors Richard Gere, Clint Eastwood, and Liam Neeson.</p><p data-characters=15 data-current-count=15 data-injectable=false>What a legend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmmpGnr7OtjKyrq52ZqK6vsNJmn66rkpa7pXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-flash-hitting-an-unwanted-dc-milestone-finally-sees-it-nipping-at-the-heels-of-marvel-and.html><span>←</span><span>The Flash hitting an unwanted DC milestone finally sees it nipping at the heels of Marvel and</span></a>
