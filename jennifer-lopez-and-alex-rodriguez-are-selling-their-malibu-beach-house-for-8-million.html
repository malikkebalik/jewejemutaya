Reworked for a masterful redesign in mind, the layout maximizes the opportunity to entertain while taking in the expansive Pacific Ocean views. Spanning over 4,400 square feet across three levels, the home includes 5 bedrooms, 4.5 bathrooms, and walls of glass doors offering access to the numerous terraces and the 50 feet of direct sandy beachfront."</strong></p><p>You can also take a look at the property in the video below from Berlyn Media:</p><p></p><p>The couple known as J.Lo and A-Rod own plenty of other homes, including one in the Hamptons and another in Coral Gables, FL. They're also selling at least one other property, a New York Madison Square Park penthouse owned by Lopez that's currently on the market for almost $25 million. Apart from the real estate front, J.Lo and A-Rod were recently reported to still be trying to purchase the New York Mets along with an anonymous billionaire investor. They've also been rumored to be working on maximizing their financial resources in preparation for the bid, and maybe selling a couple properties is a small part of that.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGeamruvtcWeqWakn6Wyu3nAp5tmmZyaxW6%2Bzp2pop%2BlmsdurdGeZKydnKG2r7OMrZ%2BeoaJiuqK4yJusZpqVlrCpeceorKydXZu8s3mXZqSipJyevK97</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-karl-jacobs-gay-what-s-his-sexual-orientation.html><span>←</span><span>Is Karl Jacobs Gay?
