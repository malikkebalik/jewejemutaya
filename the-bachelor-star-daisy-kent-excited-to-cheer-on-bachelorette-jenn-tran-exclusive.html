Are you watching it, or have you moved on from it?</strong></p><p id=par-4_57><strong>Daisy Kent:</strong> I’m excited to watch it. I started watching it. I’m excited to watch Jenn, and it will be awesome. I’m excited to cheer her on; she will do a great job. So yeah, I’m just thrilled to support her. And also, yeah, I do love the franchise, and there’s been nothing but impressive to me.</p><p id=par-5_14><strong>Being on the series has also been a springboard for other things for you.</strong></p><p id=par-6_58><strong>Daisy Kent:</strong> Yeah. I did not think on the scale that it’s been on. I didn’t know when I went on that my <a href=#>hearing loss story</a> would impact the way it did. And now, seeing that it did, it does feel like it was meant to happen and that everything in my life has happened for a reason.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-daisy-kent-is-working-to-bring-awareness-to-meningitis-after-a-college-health-scare>Daisy Kent is working to bring awareness to Meningitis after a college health scare</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-7_18><strong>Why did you feel that now is the time to tell the world about your scare from meningitis?</strong></p><p id=par-8_47><strong>Daisy Kent:</strong> So I’ve talked a lot about my past with my hearing loss and Lyme disease, but meningitis isn’t something that I’ve got to talk a lot about. That’s why I partnered with GSK on their Ask2BSure campaign: I want to raise more awareness about meningitis.</p><p id=par-9_15><strong>I would like to know your experiences when you realized it had touched your life.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/daisy-kent-dark-dress.webp?strip=all&quality=80"><p id=par-10_67><strong>Daisy Kent:</strong> So when I was a freshman in college, I woke up with a horrible headache. I went to bed, and around 2 am, I woke up. It was really, really bad. I went back to sleep, then woke up, went to biology class, and turned my head, and I had just a shocking feeling that went down my spine, like nothing I’ve ever felt before.</p><p id=par-11_81>So I went to the doctor on campus right away, and then they had me go to the ER. A guy came in in a hazmat suit, and they just started doing a bunch of tests because they kind of suspected that I had meningitis, and my vitals were crazy, so they were apprehensive. So they started treating me as if I had bacterial meningitis. It came back that I had viral meningitis. I learned that only bacterial meningitis is vaccine-preventable.</p><p id=par-12_56>Dr. Aprel Barnes, a pediatrician in West Columbia, South Carolina, explained how the disease can be transmitted. “Teens and young adults are at increased risk of meningitis, particularly from the B serogroup, due to their age and common activities, namely kissing, sharing drinks and utensils, and living in close quarters (i.e., college or military barracks).</p><p id=par-13_26>CDC data from 2015-2018 showed that meningitis B accounted for more than 60% of meningitis cases among teens and young adults 16 – 23 years old.”</p><p id=par-14_8>For more information, you can go to<a href=#> Ask2BSure.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvoq%2FHnqOoql2owaK%2BjJ2YoqupYrimutNmnLGbmamypXnCoZyeql2XrqS0xKWmq52kqbJutsSnpWasopa7brHXnKOuq5mrsm%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-taylor-swift-might-not-be-performing-a-lot-of-speak-now-and-debut-songs-on-the-eras-tour.html><span>←</span><span>Why Taylor Swift Might Not Be Performing a Lot of 'Speak Now' and Debut Songs on 'The Eras Tour'</span></a>
