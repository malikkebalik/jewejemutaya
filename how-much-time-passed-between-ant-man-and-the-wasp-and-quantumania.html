If you have not watched any of the other <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel</a> movies, but have watched Quantumania, you might be a little confused regarding when the film is set in the MCU. So, let’s take a look at everything we know about when Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is set compared to Ant-Man and the Wasp.</p><h2 id=h-how-long-after-ant-man-and-the-wasp-is-quantumania-set data-injectable=false>How long after Ant-Man and the Wasp is Quantumania set?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/avengers-endgame-cassie-lang-emma-fuhrmann-e1676462765205.png><p data-characters=612 data-current-count=912 data-injectable=true>To figure out the time difference between Ant-Man and the Wasp and its sequel, we need to know when the 2019 film took place. We know what time it took place because the post-credits scene of the film coincides with Thanos’s snap in Avengers: Infinity War. If you have forgotten, the post-credits scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp sees Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) disintegrate as a result of Thanos’s snap. We know that Infinity War took place in 2018 because <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Feige confirmed it in interviews</a> around that film’s original release.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=530 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>Because of that, we know that Ant-Man and the Wasp takes place in 2018. Roughly 23 days after the Snap, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) are rescued by Captain Marvel (Brie Larson). Shortly thereafter, the Avengers kill Thanos and the MCU progresses five years. But Scott did not experience those five years passing because he was stuck in the Quantum Realm for all that time. This gave him the idea to use the Pym Particles to travel back in time, steal the Infinity Stones, and bring everyone back.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Quantumania_quantum_realm-e1676673791356.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Quantumania-e1674582107552.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Quantumania_Scott.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Quantumania_Scott_Hope-e1673340357573.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Quantumania_Cassie_Scott-e1674933836533.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-kang.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania.jpg><p data-characters=739 data-current-count=739 data-injectable=true>Even though they completed the time heist and brought everyone who dusted during the blip back, they had still progressed five years. This five-year gap is why Scott’s daughter ages up in Avengers: Endgame, and is still older in Quantumania. Although, they also recast her from Emma Fuhrmann in Endgame to Kathryn Newton, which you can <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">read more about here</a>. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania takes place after Avengers: Endgame, which takes place in 2023. But just how long after? Well, we have got you covered for that question as according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">our article here</a>, the movie takes place in 2026 or 2027. We know this because in the first Ant-Man film, Cassie Lang was six years old, and it has been confirmed that she is 18 in Quantumania.</p><p data-characters=530 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>We know that the first Ant-Man film takes place in 2015, because it has been confirmed, yet again, by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Feige</a>. That means that Ant-Man and the Wasp is three years after the first movie, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is set nine years after that. So, between the second and third Ant-Man movies, a total of nine years have passed. This gives Scott enough time to spend five years in the Quantum Realm and come back to write his book, Look Out for the Little Guy, which he has written prior to the events of Quantumania.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-kang-1.jpg><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=782 data-injectable=true>Of course, the MCU tries to stray away from concrete dates, giving writers and directors a little leeway as to when they want to set their projects. That makes it tough to pinpoint a month or an exact date. Time also does work differently in the Quantum Realm, so we don’t have an idea as to just how much time passed when they were trapped there during the events of the film.&nbsp;But, at least we can narrow down the year of Kang the Conqueror battled Ant-Man in the Quantum Realm.</p><p data-characters=70 data-current-count=70 data-injectable=false>You can catch Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in theaters now.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXaLCpLSMraCmnV2lrrS%2FxJ1km52krLKmuoyapa1lnZa7bq3NnWStoJVixKK%2Fz2aYp5xdpsKiutOupJqmmZZ8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gary-carter-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Gary Carter Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
