<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Jeff Corwin Wife Natasha Soultanova Has Helped Him In Every Step Of Life</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Jeffrey Corwin</strong> is a well-known wildlife biologist who is best known for his animal conservation shows Ocean Mysteries with Jeff Corwin and Alaska Animal Rescue. Many of his fans, however, may be unaware that his wife, <strong>Natasha Soultanova,</strong> played a significant role in his success. His children, in particular, aided him in his professional endeavors.</p><h2>Is Natasha Soultanova Russian?</h2><p><strong>Corwin’s wife is Russian, and they have been married for 24 years</strong>. In 1996, the couple met while shopping in Cambridge, Massachusetts’ Havard Square. They began dating soon after their first meeting and married three months later. Soultanova, unlike her husband, avoids the limelight. She is only known to be Russian and to have been raised in Germany. The couple lives in Marshfield, Massachusetts, in a lake house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/voxhour.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1099612461194492528418047-1.jpg><h2>Corwin’s Daughter Assists Him at Work</h2><p>The animal lover and Soultanova have two daughters, Maya Rose Corwin and Mariana Corwin. Maya, their first daughter, was born in 2003, and their second daughter was born in 2008. Maya Rose graduated with honors in May 2021 and studied film at Temple University.</p><p>Corwin’s daughters assist him in his professional endeavors, and he includes them in his projects. For example, he took Maya to the 2013 Radio Disney Awards and his younger daughter Mariana to help him with Bermuda’s wildlife conservation project in August 2019.</p><p>In addition, on May 20, 2021, he shared with his Facebook followers that Maya assisted him in studying whale sharks, releasing black-footed ferrets to their prairie home, and maintaining their honeybee hives.</p><h2>His wife forewent college to support him</h2><p>Soultanova, Corwin’s wife, has a huge impact on his life. Soultanova was in undergrad, and the 51-year-old was in graduate school when they married, but they didn’t have enough money to fund both. So Soultanova dropped out of college to allow the Norwell native to finish his Master’s degree in Science. Furthermore, she encouraged Corwin to spend some time in 2009 on an island off the coast of Massachusetts.</p><p>According to an interview with Bonappetit in 2009, the couple lived off the grid to allow their daughters to connect with nature. There was no reliable electricity on the island. Despite the difficulties of living in such a place, the family thrived because of each other’s support. They even grew their food on the 22-acre island, including berries, vegetables, apples, and herbs.</p><p>His wife has been his partner-in-crime and a staunch supporter of his dreams, from lifting financial burdens to accompanying Corwin in every situation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiun621sMHRZ5qopV%2BfsqeyjJymq6%2BZo3q4tcWeZKeZpJbAqa2MrKaupKSWu7DCwGafmqtdnbKtvMSdZKGhnWK2r3nEr5yrsV2owaa8jKidZqSZm7Jw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-old-is-flynn-rider-from-tangled.html><span>←</span><span>How old is Flynn Rider from Tangled?</span></a>
