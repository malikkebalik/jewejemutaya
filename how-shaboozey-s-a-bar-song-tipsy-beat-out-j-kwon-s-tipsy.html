J-Kwon had some strong opinions on this development.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shaboozey-s-a-bar-song-tipsy-is-part-of-the-biggest-trend-in-country-music>Shaboozey’s ‘A Bar Song (Tipsy)’ is part of the biggest trend in country music</h2><p id=par-2_54>In recent years, combining <a href=#>country music with elements of hip-hop</a> and R&B has become a major artistic trend. Lil Nas X scored a huge hit with “Old Town Road,” Post Malone has straddled the lines between country and rap, and <a href=#>Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter</a> became one of the most critically acclaimed albums in recent memory.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_51>One of the little-known guest stars on Cowboy Carter was Shaboozey, an alternative country singer who appeared on the track “Sweet Honey Buckiin’.” Shaboozey introduced himself to a much larger audience with his hit single “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” a simple country song that interpolates elements of J-Kwon’s crunk hit “Tipsy.”</p><p id=par-4_42>During a 2024 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard</a>, J-Kwon discussed his opinion of “A Bar Song (Tipsy).” “It really ain’t even paying homage; I got a crazy percentage,” he said. “Let’s say it like this, we did that together, and I’m proud of him.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shaboozey-s-a-bar-song-tipsy-outcharted-j-kwon-s-tipsy>Shaboozey’s ‘A Bar Song (Tipsy)’ outcharted J-Kwon’s ‘Tipsy’</h2><p id=par-5_53>J-Kwon’s “Tipsy” is one of the defining records of 2004. It exemplified the crunk&B musical trend of the time. It probably deserved to be a No. 1 hit. Despite this, the track was blocked from the top spot by Usher. J-Kwon shrugged this off, saying he reached No. 1 on many other charts.</p><p id=par-6_51>In contrast, the sky was the limit for “A Bar Song (Tipsy).” “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” became Shaboozey’s first top 20 single. It has topped the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard Hot 100</a> for a single week, staying on the chart for 13 weeks in total. Perhaps Shaboozey’s is more popular because it’s more melodic.</p><p id=par-7_50>The track is part of Shaboozey’s album Where I’ve Been, Isn’t Where I’m Going. That record peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed on the chart for six weeks. Who knows if Shaboozey will become another one-hit wonder like J-Kwon or if he’s here to stay?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-j-kwon-said-tipsy-is-the-no-1-song-ever>J-Kwon said ‘Tipsy’ is ‘the No. 1 song ever’</h2><p id=par-8_84>In his Billboard interview, J-Kwon seemed to be proud of “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” on a financial level. “Any deal Kwon do, it’s Kwon,” he said. “We did huge numbers with that and I’m proud of myself because I actually structured that myself. I had consulted with — I’m just that guy, you can’t move without J-Kwon. Even with the new era, songs still move, but every song that got J-Kwon influences pops. I did a couple deals. Wait and see. You never know.”</p><p id=par-9_70>J-Kwon was asked if he wanted to say anything else before the interview was over. “I wouldn’t rather be nowhere but right here, right now,” he replied. “I’m driving through all these big-a** houses. With or without all of that, all I know is I did ‘Tipsy’ and ‘Tipsy’ is forever it. That’s the No. 1 song ever. Shaboozey’s ‘A Bar Song’ is the No. 1 song of the year.”</p><p id=par-10_19>“A Bar Song (Tipsy)” has overshadowed “Tipsy” for now but the former helped breathe new life into the latter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAqa3BqKaznamoeqJ5wZqpZqufo7RuwMipqrJlkpqutXnOrqtmol2gxLC60maroqijrnupwMylZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gisele-b%C3%BCndchen-height-how-tall-is-gisele-b%C3%BCndchen.html><span>←</span><span>Gisele Bndchen height: How tall is Gisele Bndchen?</span></a>
