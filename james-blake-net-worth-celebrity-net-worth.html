Blake made it to the finals of the 2006 Tennis Masters Cup and the semifinals at the Beijing Olympics. He made it to the quarterfinals of the US Open in 2005 and 2006 and the Australian Open in 2008.</p><p>James was named Comeback Player of the Year in 2005 after recovering from a fractured vertebra, and he was honored with the <a href=# title="Arthur Ashe Net Worth">Arthur Ashe</a> Humanitarian of the Year award in 2008.

Blake studied at Fairfield High School, where one of his classmates and friends bgnwas future Grammy-winning musician <a href=#>John Mayer</a>. James was a member of the Harlem Junior Tennis Program, and after Arthur Ashe, his role model, spoke to the young players, Blake was inspired to pursue a career as a tennis player. After high school, James attended Harvard University, but he left after two years to focus on his tennis career. Blake was inducted into the ITA Collegiate Hall of Fame in 2018.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 2001, Blake played in the Davis Cup for the first time at the age of 21, and he competed in the Cincinnati Masters and the US Open. The following year, he won the USTA Waikoloa Challenger, an ATP Tour title, and an ATP Masters Series title and made it to the ATP Masters Series event quarterfinals in Rome and to the final in Newport.

At the 2013 US Open, he announced that he was retiring. Blake returned to professional tennis in May 2023 to compete in the ITF World Tennis Tour, entering the doubles event using a wildcard. He said of his decision, "It's going to be fun. I haven't played a tournament in 10 years since I announced my retirement. I don't have any expectations. The competitive juices are still there, and I'll go out there and I'm still going to want to win."</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>James married publicist Emily Snider in 2012, and they have welcomed two daughters together. Blake enjoys playing basketball and golf, and he was runner-up on the second edition of Bravo's "Celebrity Poker Showdown." In 2008, he founded the charity The James Blake Foundation, which is "dedicated to cancer research and finding a cure." According to Blake's official website, the foundation "invests vital seed money at the leading-edge of science: speeding the most promising work, and shortening the time it takes to turn lab discoveries into better treatments for patients." In 2005, he began hosting a charity tennis exhibition/music event called "Anthem Live!" to raise funds for cancer research, and a few years later, he established a fund in honor of his father, the Thomas Blake, Sr. Memorial Research Fund, in support of cancer research at Manhattan's Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.</p><p>In September 2015, a plainclothes NYPD officer threw James on the sidewalk, handcuffed him, and arrested him after mistaking him for a man who was suspected of credit card fraud. Commissioner <a href=# title="William Bratton Net Worth">William Bratton</a> apologized to Blake and said that the "arrest raised serious questions about [the officer's] actions" while denying allegations of racism. James filed a lawsuit against the city of New York, but he later withdrew it "on the condition that the city establish a legal fellowship to investigate police misconduct and advocate for victims of brutality." Blake wrote about the incident in the 2017 book "Ways of Grace: Stories of Activism, Adversity, and How Sports Can Bring Us Together," and the officer who arrested him sued him for defamation. A judge dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>in 2005, Blake paid $1.5 million for a 5,856 square foot, five-bedroom mansion in Tampa, Florida. He moved out around 2013 and began renting the home out. In May 2014, the home went up in flames, and authorities discovered that "a family of four had been shot in their bedrooms, doused in fire accelerant and surrounded by commercial-grade fireworks." The victims were identified as Darrin and Kim Campbell and their 16-year-old daughter Megan and 19-year-old son Colin. Police later concluded that Darrin "shot his wife and two teenage children in the head, then scattered gasoline and fireworks around the mansion they rented before setting the home ablaze and killing himself."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkv6qvx56qrWWkmruvtdJooZqllah6o7jApJxmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tony-shalhoub-s-net-worth-and-how-he-avoided-being-typecast-as-a-terrorist.html><span>←</span><span>Tony Shalhoub's Net Worth and How He Avoided Being Typecast As a Terrorist</span></a>
