After gaining widespread recognition for her central role in the 2010 western film "True Grit," Steinfeld has been steadily making her name in the entertainment world. Since arriving on the scene in spectacular fashion, Hailee has appeared in a range of high profile films. Her many starring roles have won her a number of award nominations. Her role in "True Grit" earned her an Academy Award nomination, while she was honored with a Golden Globe nomination for a subsequent role in "Edge of Seventeen."</p><p>Outside of her appearances on the big screen, Hailee is known for her rolesin television series such as "Dickinson." She is also an established voice actress, having booked a notable voice role in the critically-acclaimed animated film "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse." In addition, Steinfeld has been steadily pursuing a music career since 2015, when she performed the track "Flashlight" in the film "Pitch Perfect 2." A record label contract soon followed, and Hailee then released her debut EP "Haiz" in 2015. A number of her songs have charted well since then, and Steinfeld released another EP entitled "Half Written Story" in 2020.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Hailee Steinfeld was born on December 11th of 1996 in Los Angeles, California. Raised in the neighborhood of Tarzana alongside an older brother, Hailee was inspired to get into acting by her cousin, True O'Brien. True had landed a role in a television commercial at the age of eight, and Steinfeld decided to try it out for herself as a result.</p><p>Steinfeld grew up in a family with Jewish, Christian, Filipino, and African-American heritage. Although she initially attended schools in California, Hailee was homeschooled from 2008 to the year of her high school graduation in 2015.</p><p>Hailee's uncle is fitness entrepreneur <a href=#>Jake Steinfeld</a>. Hailee's father, Peter, and Jake are brother.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>After starting her acting career at the age of 10, Steinfeld gained a foothold in the industry by appearing in a number of short films. She gained particularly high levels of exposure after starring in the film "She's a Fox." During this period, Hailee also landed a number of guest-starring roles in various television series and appeared in a range of commercials. After three years of earning her stripes, Steinfeld joined the cast of "True Grit," playing the character of Mattie Ross at the age of 13.</p><p>Released in 2010 to widespread critical acclaim, "True Grit" put Hailee Steinfeld on the map. She was singled out for praise by critics, and she later earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

She landed the role of Juliet, which proved to be somewhat controversial – as the script initially called for nudity and sex scenes involving the young actress. However, the script was quickly changed after Steinfeld was cast. Unfortunately, critics were not kind to the resulting production.</p><p>Steinfeld's other film of 2013 was equally unsuccessful. "Ender's Game" received lackluster reviews and proved to be a box office bomb. Over the next few years, Steinfeld appeared in less mainstream films such as "Begin Again." She also joined the cast of the film "Why We Broke Up," but the film has yet to go into production. "Ten Thousand Saints" was another notable film during this period, and it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2015.
