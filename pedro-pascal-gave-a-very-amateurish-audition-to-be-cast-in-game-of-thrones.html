With a&nbsp;little&nbsp;help from <a href=#>his friend Sarah Paulson</a>, Pascal landed the role that would make him famous. But securing the role alone was no small feat. Showrunner David&nbsp;Benoiff&nbsp;was looking for a peculiar mix of characteristics when casting the Oberyn. And all of these traits&nbsp;might’ve&nbsp;been difficult to find in just one actor.</p><p id=par-3_63>“That was such a tricky role to cast,”&nbsp;Benoiff&nbsp;told <a href=#>Variety</a>.&nbsp;“Oberyn entered the story&nbsp;mid-stream,&nbsp;but required the swagger of a character who had been sparring with the other players off-screen for years. We were looking for an actor with charisma, sexual energy, physical menace&nbsp;and&nbsp;depth. He had to be seductive to both men and women; he had to be someone the audience could believe as a killer.”</p><p id=par-4_25>Pascal would send his audition tape to Benoiff, who took notice of how low-budget the audition tape was.&nbsp;But&nbsp;the questionable presentation of the audition&nbsp;didn’t&nbsp;matter once&nbsp;Pascal’s&nbsp;performance began.</p><p id=par-5_52>“First of all, it was an iPhone selfie audition, which was unusual. And this&nbsp;wasn’t&nbsp;one of the new-fangled iPhones with the fancy cameras,”&nbsp;Benoiff said in a 2020 interview with <a href=#>Variety</a>.&nbsp;“It looked like s***;&nbsp;it was shot&nbsp;vertical; the whole thing was very amateurish. Except for the performance, which was intense and believable and just right.”</p><p id=par-6_14>The showrunner confided that after working with Pascal, he&nbsp;had no doubt&nbsp;that&nbsp;he’d&nbsp;be successful&nbsp;beyond&nbsp;Game of Thrones.</p><p id=par-7_54>“Once we saw the entire season&nbsp;there&nbsp;was no doubt Pedro was going to be a star,”&nbsp;Benoiff&nbsp;said.&nbsp;“I thought he deserved more recognition, frankly. Was he nominated for any awards? He should have been. But Dan and I were thrilled that we gave Pedro a job that helped his&nbsp;ascent,&nbsp;because&nbsp;he’s&nbsp;an absolute gem of an actor and a man.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-didn-t-david-benoiff-keep-pedro-pascal-on-the-show>Why&nbsp;didn’t&nbsp;David&nbsp;Benoiff&nbsp;keep Pedro Pascal on the show?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_46>Pascal’s&nbsp;Oberyn&nbsp;wasn’t&nbsp;destined&nbsp;to last&nbsp;long&nbsp;in&nbsp;Game of Thrones.&nbsp;The character would end up with the same fate he had in George R.R.&nbsp;Martin’s&nbsp;books, dying <a href=#>at the hands of The Mountain</a>. As much as Benoiff and others adored working with Pascal, they&nbsp;couldn’t&nbsp;let their love for the actor change the direction of his character.</p><p id=par-9_38>“I&nbsp;mean, we love Pedro. And we loved that character,”&nbsp;Benoiff&nbsp;said.&nbsp;“But his death at the hands of the Mountain was one of our favorite brutal killings from&nbsp;George’s&nbsp;books. Part of the reason people remember Oberyn is because he died so horribly.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-pedro-pascal-shared-game-of-thrones-was-what-helped-change-his-life>Pedro Pascal shared&nbsp;‘Game of Thrones’&nbsp;was what helped change his&nbsp;life</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_47>Pascal had been around the film industry for many years. He had bit parts <a href=#>in shows like&nbsp;Buffy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Law & Order, slowly building up his portfolio But he&nbsp;really&nbsp;credited&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;for his newfound fame. After starring in the hit HBO series, Pascal confided he was&nbsp;being noticed&nbsp;far more than ever before.</p><p id=par-11_31>“My life changed.&nbsp;I’ve&nbsp;been getting to see the world. No matter where you go,&nbsp;there’s&nbsp;going to a place where&nbsp;they’re&nbsp;really into&nbsp;Narcos&nbsp;and&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;the guy from&nbsp;Narcos,&nbsp;or the guy from&nbsp;Game of Thrones,”&nbsp;Pascal told Entertainment Tonight (via <a href=#>Female First</a>).</p><p id=par-12_8>Pacal&nbsp;was even noticed&nbsp;in places&nbsp;where he never thought&nbsp;that&nbsp;he’d&nbsp;be recognized.</p><p id=par-13_48>“I&nbsp;was&nbsp;snorkelling, and this person kept on looking at me.&nbsp;I remember I got&nbsp;really&nbsp;nervous because I thought there was a shark or something&nbsp;…&nbsp;He’s&nbsp;just, like, coming toward me and without introducing himself or anything, he&nbsp;just&nbsp;pulls out his GoPro and&nbsp;he&nbsp;takes a picture of us.&nbsp;[He just said]&nbsp;‘Gracias!’&nbsp;[and I&nbsp;realized&nbsp;I’d&nbsp;been&nbsp;recognized] even floating out at sea.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9prDRqGSpmaOYrq15xpqtnmWRoq61sdSroKygXZbCpbXToqanZZOWwLV5xpqknmWfm3q1tNGopZ6rXp3BrriO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./luis-roberto-alves-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Luis Roberto Alves Net Worth</span></a>
