<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>7 Ways Drake Should Have Reacted to That Lap Dance in Nicki Minaj's &amp;quot;Anaconda&amp;quot; Video</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>In a post-"Anaconda" world, and having seen the music video as many times as I have since morning, I can't help but start to notice some of the little nuances of the video. Oh sure, the <a href=# class=T3D>"Anaconda" music video</a> is a four minute long ode to big booties, but it's so much more than that. It's an homage to "Baby Got Back". It's an anthem to the fat bottom. It's got a scene at the end that will make anyone silently hoping that Nicki Minaj and Drake become a couple scream with joy. Except for me. For me, it just made me scream in confusion. I mean, seriously, Drake, what were you doing?</p><p>The "Anaconda" video ends with a guest appearance from Drake, sitting in a chair and doing absolutely nothing while Nicki Minaj gives him the world's greatest lap dance. Oh, sure, he makes a bunch of faces, but am I the only one who thought Drake looked a little too serious and, dare I say it, bored for a man in his position? What man wouldn't love to get a lap dance from Nicki Minaj? What man would have this face on while receiving it?</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Apparently only one man: Drake. Listen, Drake, there are millions of men who would kill to be in your position so the least you could do is act like you're enjoying yourself a lot more. In fact, I can think of at least seven better ways you could have responded to your video lap dance.</p><h3>1. Shock</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Whether you're surprised that Minaj can view you like a brother and then grind on you like this, or surprised at her "superb ass", no one would blame you for your shock.</p><h3>2. Dismay</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Oh my god, Drake, look at her butt. <a href=# class=T3D>Drake and Rihanna might have gotten back together</a> and he's expected to sit there in that chair and get that lap dance and <i>not</i> react? Sounds like a horror story to me.</p><h3>3. Indifference</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Considering what an affectionate relationship you have with Minaj, maybe you really don't see what the big deal is about her smooth dance moves. Yes, Nicki Minaj has a great butt. So what? Your anaconda don't want none.</p><h3>4. Amusement</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Let's be honest. This is kind of a hilarious situation for Drake to find himself in.</p><h3>5. Smugness</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Then again, hilarious or otherwise, every man in the world wanted to be Drake right then. And Drake knows it. So why wasn't he smug? Why wasn't he smirking? Why wasn't he waggling his eyebrows at the camera? What's wrong with you, Drake?</p><h3>6. Laughter</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>With the number of times they must have had to rehearse this exact sequence, I'm finding it hard to believe that Drake managed not to burst into laughter that whole time. At some point, that lap dance had to go from hot to predictable to kind of funny really.</p><h3>7. Joining In</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>May this music video usher in a new meme wave of Drake superimposed on Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda" album cover, please and thank you. I bet he can give a great lap dance.</p><p>Watch the video below.</p><p></p><p><i>Image: YouTube</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx0gpNxbGZvXayuur%2BMnamao5ViwKm71KWbZqCRq7JuvsSamq2dlGLBsHnToZitZZyWvW6wwKeanmWZo3qvtcKkoGalmaOuq7%2BMmqWam5%2BjsaJ51aKbnqc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-meaning-of-si-in-chemistry.html><span>←</span><span>What is the meaning of SI in chemistry?</span></a>
