In May 2021, Neville announced his retirement from touring, stating, "I love singing for others, it provides so much joy for me, at least as much as for those listening, if not more. Unfortunately, the grueling nature of travel and the schedule needed to make a tour work has become less than desirable."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Aaron Neville was born Aaron Joseph Neville on January 24, 1941, in New Orleans, Louisiana. He is the son of Amelia Landry and Arthur Neville Sr. Aaron grew up in the Calliope housing project with his brothers Art, Cyril, and Charles. Sadly, Charles died of pancreatic cancer in 2018, and Art passed away in 2019 "after years of declining health." Neville's uncle was George "<a href=# title="Big Chief Net Worth">Big Chief</a> Jolly" Landry, the lead vocalist of a Mardi Gras Indian group called the Wild Tchoupitoulas. Aaron has a tattoo of a sword on his face, which he got at the age of 16. In a 2019 interview with "Billboard," he stated, "My dad made me scrub it with Brillo Pads and Octagon Soap. The skin came off, but the tattoo stayed. But some years later, I had an album out called 'The Tattooed Heart,' and we were doing a special thing in a tattoo parlor, so I let them go over it and outline it – freshen it up."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-356838 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Aaron-Neville.jpg alt width=900 height=596 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-356838 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 1960, "Over You" became the first of Neville's singles to receive airplay outside of New Orleans, and it reached #21 on the "Billboard" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

The article mentioned that Aaron dedicates his albums to St. Jude, who is the patron saint of lost causes.
