Recommended Videos Taylor Sheridan’s 1923 has given us a look into one of the earliest branches of the Dutton family tree and, with that, a look at one of the most iconic romances in entertainment — one that is quickly growing on fans who have already set the bar high for love stories within the Yellowverse. When Spencer Dutton first met Alex in Africa, he assumed he was crossing paths with another woman who might be drawn in by his uninterested charm and badassery."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Perhaps he’d spend some time with her, not exactly an evening, but a few hours until he moved on, giving no part of himself away. What happened instead was a chance encounter that would bring him face to face with something he’d long escaped: the idea of true love. During their initial conversation, Alex felt it too, for the first time, and she was willing to risk everything for it — including her soon-to-be wedding to the man who should have been suitable for her.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>In those tense moments with Spencer, she realized that living safely didn’t mean living well, and she gave up everything for a chance at a life of love. Following him to his next job, Alex abandoned everything and opened her heart to the man she’d eventually marry. Falling in love with Spencer has been quite a journey so far, full of ups and downs, and it’s reminiscent of another great love story — Titanic.</p><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=141 data-injectable=false>When asked if the similarities between Jack and Rose were lost on them, Schlaepfer told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a> that they certainly were not.</p><p>“Oh, certainly not. From the beginning, we were like, ‘This has major&nbsp;Titanic&nbsp;vibes,’ and you do get that from the characters a little bit. And yes, we were certainly singing a lot of&nbsp;Titanic, and I’m sure there’s a lot of BTS footage out there of us singing. We would literally perform for the crew. We’d stand on the deck of the ship, and they would all be doing their jobs, just setting up cameras and stuff like that. And while we were waiting to film, we’d literally dance around together and sing ‘My Heart Will Go On.’ (Laughs.) I don’t know if they appreciated it very much, but that footage is out there somewhere.”</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>We’re not sure what you plan to do with that information, but we’re clearing our schedules so that we can ask anyone anywhere how to get that footage and ensure that we’ll all be able to see it eventually. Can you imagine Sklenar and Schlaepfer belting out one of the most romantic songs of all time? Be still our beating hearts!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 1923 Official (@1923official)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>Things haven’t been easy on Alex and Spencer, but they’ve been worth it, and that’s part of the intricately woven journey of the Dutton family. They face the hardships that cross their paths with grit and determination that few can use, let alone hold at all. The season finale proves that they’re capable of making choices together and on their own, and they will need that power more than ever.</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>As we saw Spencer being taken oceans away from Alex during 1923‘s season finale episode, it’s clear that it will take a lot of work to reunite these two. It’s not lost on anyone that it would probably be easier on both of them to call their romance a fleeting love and be done with it, but the Duttons don’t do easy.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=719 data-injectable=true>Of course, fans noticed that Alex was quite seasick on the boat, something she’d not dealt with before. With Spencer Dutton as charming as he is drop-dead gorgeous, it’s not out of the realm of possibility that she might be getting ill for another reason. Schlaepfer says it’s something she’s considered herself, but she’s as in the dark as we are.</p><p>“Honestly, I have not been told a single thing, but I have my theories, but when I was filming those scenes, there were definitely some moments where I was choosing to believe that maybe it was more than motion sickness. But there has been no confirmation from Taylor [Sheridan, creator] at all, so it could have just been those waves.”</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=false>Sheridan keeps his cards close to his chest, so it’s not surprising that Schlaepfer is unsure of what the future may hold for her, but we’re crossing our fingers that they’re brought back together quickly. You can watch the first season of 1923 in its entirety now on Paramount Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e5ByaWxlo6mus3nJrqOimV2osKm4wJ6nn52iYryvedOhnGasmamur7XCZpysqaWaerO7zJqlnJ1dl7K1w8SepWaZnJrFbq3NnWSsqJWjsKa%2BjJqlnWWYmr9utM6pnKxllqS%2FbsDHnqCrZZaqwba%2BxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./everybody-loves-raymond-s-patricia-heaton-said-she-ll-do-anything-for-her-kids.html><span>←</span><span>'Everybody Loves Raymond's Patricia Heaton Said She'll Do Anything for Her Kids</span></a>
