However, in 2017, he revealed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>&nbsp;that had gone through a “two-year battle with&nbsp;throat cancer” and that “a procedure on his&nbsp;trachea reduced his voice to a rasp.” Kilmer began using an electric voice box and underwent two&nbsp;tracheotomies as well as chemotherapy. Today he is said to be cancer-free although he now has a&nbsp;feeding tube because he can no longer eat.</p><p id=par-4_30>After 35 years, Kilmer was able to reprise his role by working with a London company, Sonantic, using artificial intelligence technology to re-create his iconic voice for <a href=#>the film’s sequel</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Val-Kilmer-who-plays-Iceman-introduces-a-special-screening-of-Top-Gun.jpg><h2>The actor lived on a ranch in New Mexico for two decades</h2><p id=par-5_27>Kilmer grew up in Los Angeles County but in 1991 moved far away from the bright lights of Hollywood to a ranch just outside Santa Fe.</p><p id=par-6_51><a href=#>CBS</a> reported in 2011 that the Batman Forever actor sold most of his 5,328-acre Pecos River Ranch in San Miguel County, to a Texas oil and gas executive.
