The duo toured the UK and US again in 2014-15 with a program they called 'The At Odds Couple'.</p><p>In 2008, Tilbrook previewed new material while on tour with the Fluffers, two members of whom are also members of the latest Squeeze line-up. A four-track single, "Binga Bong!", was released in November 2008. The album Pandemonium Ensues, credited to Glenn Tilbrook and The Fluffers, was released in March 2009. The 14-track album was produced by Tilbrook and Andrew J. Jones, and mixed by <a href=#>Bob Clearmountain</a>. It featured guest appearances from Johnny Depp on "Too Close to the Sun" and Depp's then girlfriend, <a href=#>Vanessa Paradis</a>, on "Interest & Love".</p><p>In April 2007, Tilbrook released The Past Has Been Bottled, the first in a five-disc series of remastered demos.
