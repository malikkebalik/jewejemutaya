It’s one of the key issues being spoken about in renegotiations for union contracts in the public campaign behind the moniker #NewDeal4Animation.</p><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>Bennett also revealed that Netflix employed another loophole in current contracts. In a reply, they said that Netflix paid its animators and crew to produce two separate, 26-episode seasons. However, the company would actually distribute it as five seasons. The common exploit lets Netflix avoid raising wages on subsequent seasons, which Bennett confirmed was the case. The second order of 26 episodes saw just a three percent increase in pay, according to Bennett.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Two 26-episode orders that were produced back-to back (with no raise between, just the 3% cost-of-living yearly increase–which of course didn't match the 6-8% rate of inflation)! Unfortunately common at the time… now, even orders that "long" are rare!</p>— Jen Bennett #NewDeal4Animation (@Jen_Benben) <a href=#>March 30, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true>Series creator, the cartoonist and producer <a href=#>ND Stevenson</a>, also added their voice to the conversation in support of the #NewDeal4Animation. “The only reason She-Ra was possible was because of the passion of people like Jen on our crew,” they said. “That passion was exploited as an excuse to underpay, understaff, and overwork. No one should have to go through that again.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>The only reason She-Ra was possible was because of the passion of people like Jen on our crew…and that passion was exploited as an excuse to underpay, understaff, and overwork.
