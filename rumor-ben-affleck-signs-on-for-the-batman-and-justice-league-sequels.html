Nevertheless, the rumor mill continues to operate at full tilt, and one possible nugget of information concerns the World’s Greatest Detective.</p><p data-characters=663 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>Now, if you’ve been following along on the DCEU Leaks subreddit lately, you’ll know that it’s gone a bit out of control, finding itself populated with fan fiction galore being passed off as real information and valid scoops. As such, it’s starting to become tough to know which threads to trust and which ones to disregard, but this particular leak does seem somewhat credible – at least compared to the others – and as such, we’ve decided it’s worth sharing. After all, Reddit has yielded some accurate information in the past, so it’s important that we don’t ignore everything that comes out of there.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/149705237839443-3.jpeg alt width=733 height=388 sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=592 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>Anyways, what we’re hearing today is that Ben Affleck has signed on for three more appearances as the Caped Crusader. There’s the sequel to The Batman, <a href=#>Justice League 2</a> and one other project, which is currently unknown. While it may seem unlikely that the actor would commit to several more flicks before JL&nbsp;even&nbsp;hits theatres, the report goes on to state that Matt Reeves’ pitch for the Dark Knight’s solo outing has everyone pretty excited and hyped, which is likely why Ben felt confident enough to sign on for more – assuming this rumor is true, of course.</p><p data-characters=594 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>There’s no further information on what lies beyond those three appearances, but hearing that Ben’s now locked in for the next little while is definitely encouraging. Again, there’s a very good chance that this scoop will turn out to be nothing more than wishful thinking and hold no truth, but you can check out the full Reddit posting via the link down below and decide for yourself whether or not it’s accurate. One thing’s for certain though, and that’s if this does indeed turn out to be on the level, then the DCEU’s future just got even brighter.</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=false>Ben Affleck’s Dark Knight&nbsp;will next be featured at the forefront of Zack Snyder’s&nbsp;Justice League&nbsp;on November 17th. This, coupled with the fact that Matt Reeves has his hands full with&nbsp;<a href=#>War For the Planet of the Apes</a>, leads us to believe that&nbsp;<strong>The Batman</strong>&nbsp;won’t begin filming in earnest until 2018. It may be some time before we get any official updates then, but as always, watch this space for more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqa6ln6d6o7HNZpifnpyasKx50qKep6tdl661ucCnZKOto6m2pLGMpZyan6WaerSx0K6cpWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joleon-lescott-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Joleon Lescott Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
