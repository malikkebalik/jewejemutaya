Fans may not know or remember the fact that <a href=#>Sharon Case</a> is not the original Sharon Collins-Newman. Two others played the part before she took over the role. Here’s what we know.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Monica Potter is the original Sharon Collins-Newman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Monica-Potter.jpg><p id=par-2_32>It’s been a while since a big <a href=#>cast member from The Young and the Restless</a> has been replaced. One semi-recent recasting includes Gina Tognoni as Phyllis when Michelle Stafford dipped out.</p><p id=par-3_31>However, <a href=#>some Y&R fans</a> may not remember when Sharon Collins-Newman was played by anyone other than Sharon Case. The role, which was introduced in 1994, was first given to Monica Potter.</p><p id=par-4_29>Two months later, Potter was out and Heidi Mark took over. Two months after that, Case came in and has stayed in the role ever since. What’s the deal?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why did Case replace Potter and Mark?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_35>As a fan-favorite who’s outlasted former <a href=#>versions of “Sharon,”</a> Case doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. The Young and the Restless has given her notoriety, steady work, and a place where co-stars are family.</p><p id=par-6_11>That said, Potter and Mark took different paths. But what happened?</p><p id=par-7_22>“I worked on The Young And The Restless, and was fired because I was terrible,” Potter told <a href=#>Craig Ferguson</a> in 2010.</p><p id=par-8_42>“I had to dance in like a bathing suit and, you know, they put all this paint on you like you’re supposed to be tan and there’s music in the background, but there’s not really music. But I just couldn’t do it.”</p><p id=par-9_58>As for Potter’s replacement, Mark’s departure may have had something to do with a Playboy centerfold gig. According to former husband and Mötley Crüe bandmate, Vince Neil, the network fired her after she posed nude for the magazine. Neil’s 2010 book, Tattoos & Tequila: To Hell and Back with One of Rock’s Most Notorious Frontmen, detailed the exit.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Potter and Mark continued acting</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_37>Both women who played Sharon didn’t let the firing derail them. Potter went on to start in plenty of successful projects including Boston Legal, Parenthood, and her latest recurring role opposite Jeremy Piven, Wisdom of the Crowd.</p><p id=par-11_39>The actress also runs Monica Potter Home which sells home goods, skincare, and home decor. Mark ‘s recent credit happened in 2017. Before that, she starred in TV shows like Diagnosis Murder, Charmed, and Love Boat: The Next Wave.</p><p id=par-12_21>While both Potter and Mark have once since moved on from Y&R, they’ll always remain a part of soap opera history.</p><p id=par-13_9><a href=#>The Young and the Restless</a> airs weekdays on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMsqauppdirq%2BwjK2fnmWimsC1uMSsqmavmK56uLHRnmSmp56esKJ5z6irrZ2iYq6vsIyhnKKcmWK6or7KZp2iqpWZeqe%2BzqZkraCVYr%2BwuMRmpp9lo52us7vNZ5%2BtpZxk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rust-armorer-hannah-gutierrez-reed-given-maximum-sentence-of-18-months.html><span>←</span><span>Rust armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed given maximum sentence of 18 months</span></a>
