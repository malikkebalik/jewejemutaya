Mark Shoen earned his multi-billion fortune by being the largest shareholder of Amerco, the parent-company of moving and storage company U-Haul. U-Haul was founded by Mark's parents Leonard and Anny Mary &nbsp;Shoen in 1945.&nbsp;The company&nbsp;became an enormous success thanks largely to&nbsp;Mark Shoen who led the company for 40 years until his retirement in 2012. His most influential years were in the period from 1994 to 2007 when he served as U-Haul's president. In his time, Shoen fought for the efforts to modernize its vehicle fleet and he even started philanthropic initiatives to aid veterans and disaster victims.</p><p>While Mark is retired now, his brother Joe Shoen still serves as the company's CEO. The Shoen family also controls the majority of U-Haul's parent company AMERCO, which&nbsp;generates over&nbsp;$4 billion in revenue each year. However, U-Haul is not the only source of Mark's fortune. He derives part of his riches from holding one of the largest private self-storage operations in the States, with more than 400 properties across the country. As a graduate of the College of the Holy Cross, Mark Shoen has been actively contributed to Catholic charities.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq970aKaoZ2jqXqjtculoKimkZ6%2Fpr%2BOppiro12otbCxzWalnqxdrLyzwMdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kiefer-sutherland-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Kiefer Sutherland Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
