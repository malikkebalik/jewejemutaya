Even Jamie Lee Curtis admitted it was a ‚Äúweird movie,‚Äù because she had to play both a 15-year-old and a 45-year-old ‚Äî though she also said it was among the best acting experiences of her life.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Philadelphia Shooting Suspect: Is Kimbrady Carriker Transgender?</h2><time>Jul 15, 2024</time>
