The government remained closed for 21 days when Clinton and Congressional Republicans disagreed about how to balance the country’s budget.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This time, the government partially shut down after President Donald Trump refused to sign any spending bill that did not include $5 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Talks dissolved between the White House and Congressional leaders, leaving a number of federal agencies without funding.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Since then, Democrats, who took control of the House of Representatives at the start of this year, have tried to pass legislation to reopen the government. But the President has not changed his position and they have been unable to reach a deal.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Trump has suggested he would keep the federal government partially shut down for “<a href=#>months or even years</a>” if he does not get funding for his border wall, and threatened on Thursday to declare a <a href=#>national emergency</a> to go around Congress if necessary.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The government shutdown is already affecting about <a href=#>800,000 workers</a> and many Americans who rely on <a href=#>government services</a>. So far, the shutdown has meant that national parks are filling up with trash and many are closed, that some government loans and grants are not being processed, that Coast Guard members and others have been forced to work without pay, and that the Food and Drug Administration has stopped its routine food safety inspections, among other consequences.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many federal employees would have been <a href=# rel=noopener>paid on Friday</a> under normal circumstances, but have now missed that paycheck.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If the shutdown continues, federal district courts could run out of funds to operate and, by the end of this month, federal workers could miss a second paycheck. By February, there would be even more serious consequences, as many agencies would need to develop longer-term plans for how to operate with limited staff and no funding.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is not the first long shutdown in the country’s history. The government has partially or completely shut down 21 times in the last four decades since the modern method of budgeting began.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After the Clinton-era showdown, the next-longest shutdown lasted 17 days in 1978, under former President Jimmy Carter, and another lasted 16 days in 2013 under former President Barack Obama.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But shutdowns were once not this serious. Before the 1980s, the government continued operating even if Congress didn’t pass funding bills on time, according to The <a href=# rel=noopener>New York Times</a>. The then-U.S. Attorney General passed new guidelines in 1980 and 1981 saying the government had to stop spending money unless it had actual appropriations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many of the shutdowns since then have lasted just a few days, or even a few hours in the case of a shutdown last February. But with the precedent set in 1995, and now President Trump’s demands, significant chunks of the government will remain closed until an agreement is reached.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubGlugHqDjqyfrqyUpMSvecuopaCdo6l6qbXSraarsV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paige-hurd-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Paige Hurd Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
