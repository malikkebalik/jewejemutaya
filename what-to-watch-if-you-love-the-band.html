It was an enormous success, winning them Album of the Year at the Grammys and becoming one of the top-selling albums of all time. It also came at a point of heightened stress, drug use, and interpersonal arguments for the band.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-5_47>The documentary&nbsp;Fleetwood Mac: Rumours&nbsp;from&nbsp;Classic Albums&nbsp;captures the band during this momentous period.
