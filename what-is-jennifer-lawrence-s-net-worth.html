In televised appearances, she comes across as self-deprecating and effortlessly hilarious, and somehow never seems to let her immense fame go to her head.</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>Despite her matter-of-fact personality, few people can argue against the fact that J-Law is one of Hollywood’s biggest stars. She is one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-paid</a> actresses in Hollywood and continues to dominate the box office more than a decade after her debut in the first Hunger Games film.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Jennifer Lawrence’s net worth</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1153778824.jpg><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>After around a decade and a half of roles in film and television, Lawrence has accumulated some pretty massive wealth. She reportedly makes millions per film role these days, after starting her career with a measly $3000 weekly paycheck. Her income has since rocketed, going from $500,000 for The Hunger Games to more than $30 million for Mockingjay Part 2, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=808 data-injectable=false>These days, Lawrence earns a solid $15 million at base for most any film role. These high paychecks have earned her a net worth of around $160 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Her most recent role in Netflix’s critically-acclaimed Don’t Look Up earned her a salary of $25 million. She also owns several lucrative pieces of property, most of them in New York, that are worth several million apiece.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZqau6%2B1xZ6pZqSRrL%2BmusKeqmamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-harry-styles-think-about-god-religion.html><span>←</span><span>What Does Harry Styles Think About God &amp;amp; Religion?</span></a>
