However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, no one, not even Roger Godell, is sure if it will begin on time when it will begin, or if it will begin at all. Fingers crossed that the world has this virus beat by August so we can get our football fix from both the NFL and NCAA. Not only that, but there are also some fat NFL quarterback contracts out there and the guaranteed money of the 10 highest paid quarterbacks is pretty insane!</p><p>Consider the fact that NFL contracts are not all that player-friendly. Fully guaranteed contracts are nearly non-existent. The average NFL career only lasts three years as well, so it can be hard to make a lot of money—as we know from all the stories of former professional football players that are broke after their NFL career ends. If you're a quarterback, the chance of a guaranteed contract and making good money are an easier proposition, as you can see from the 10 quarterbacks below. From Matt Ryan to <a href=#>Tom Brady</a>, these athletes will take home a guaranteed amount ranging from $50 million to $94.5 million from their current contracts.</p><p>Tom Brady comes in 10th on the list of the richest NFL quarterback contracts with the $50 million he's guaranteed to make with his brand new two-year contract with Tampa Bay. Speaking of Brady, it's going to be weird seeing him in a Buccaneers jersey and how long will it take Pats fans to get over losing their golden boy? The Atlanta Falcons' <a href=#>Matt Ryan</a> has the richest contract of any NFL quarterback. He earns $30 million a year and is guaranteed to make $94.5 million on his current five-year contract, which started with the 2019-2020 season.</p><p>There are a lot of familiar names on the list of players with the richest NFL quarterback contracts, so let's dive right into it.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-297212 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-632420678.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-297212 class=wp-caption-text>Rob Carr/Getty Images</p><p>#10.
