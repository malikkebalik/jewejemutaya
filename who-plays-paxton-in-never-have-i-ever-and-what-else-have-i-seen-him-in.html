From there, the jobs kept trickling in.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true>2018 saw Barnet score one of his first major roles as “Hot Seth” in Turnt, a teen drama that set the stage for his debut in Never Have I Ever, as well as a poorly received horror movie, Instakiller. While Turnt was well received, Instakiller was widely panned — though it wasn’t Barnet’s performance that drew critics’ ire, and his prospects dwindled the following year.</p><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>2019 was relatively dry for Barnet. He made an appearance in the series Family Reunion, but his part was short-lived, with the actor only appearing in a single episode. While many of his early roles are considered bit parts — like most Hollywood performers at the beginning of their careers — Barnet showcased his talent, bringing plenty of nuance to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">even the smallest roles</a>. 2019 may have been rough for the actor’s professional life, but his first big break was just around the corner.</p><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>2020, and the start of Netflix’s Never Have I Ever, saw the first real surge in Barnet’s career. Critics loved his performance as the broody Paxton, and fans were enthralled by his swoon-inducing good looks. His popularity on the show opened a slew of doors for the American actor, and helped him get his foot in the door for more prolific big-screen projects. He starred in Untitled Horror Movie, a 2021 comedy horror that was incredibly well received by critics and viewers alike, as well as Netflix’s Love Hard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Darren-Barnet-netflix-lovehard.jpg><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=754 data-injectable=true>Since his success on Never Have I Ever, Barnet has appeared in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. as Wilfred “Freddy” Malick, as well as landing the starring role in some grade-A garbage, like the direct-to-video American Pie Presents: Girls’ Rule. In addition to his onscreen appearances, the last few years have seen Barnet lend his mellifluous tones to various animated projects like Samurai Rabbit: The Usagi Chronicles, Skull Island, and Blue Eye Samurai.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>With season four of Never Have I Ever marking the end of the series, Barnet’s calendar has opened up. The actor is keeping busy, however, and has a decent number of potentially high-profile projects coming up.
