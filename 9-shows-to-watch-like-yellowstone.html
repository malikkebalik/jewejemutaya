The Duttons are all powerful, strong, and quite stubborn, believing they know what’s best for their family (above anyone else) and often acting upon it without consulting anyone first. They all have a similar end goal, but their journeys to finding it are all quite different.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>Amid their struggles, the Dutton family also has to learn to trust and gain the trust of particular people in their circles — relying on those they’d rather keep their distance from. The Native American storyline within the series is also important, especially in the most recent seasons.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>There’s also the beautiful scenery, the romance, and the sexual tension that keeps viewers intrigued from episode to episode. Rip Wheeler and Beth Dutton have gained a cult following, Kayce and Monica Dutton have taken fans on a love/hate journey, and patriarch John Dutton has had a love interest (or two) across the series so far.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Yellowstone (@yellowstone)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>There’s also the whole ranch setting in a surreal location with animal interaction and wildlife, which is breathtaking and appeals to all the senses, taking you on a beautiful ride.

The journey is anything but smooth. In fact, it’s pretty intense and painful — full of heartache and loss.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>The ten-episode series saw what the arduous road to owning the land now called the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch was like and why there’s such a power struggle for the family to keep it.
