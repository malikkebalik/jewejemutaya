The two formed a relationship, began singing together, and tied the knot in 1962. But during their marriage, the “Proud Mary” singer endured abuse at the hands of her husband. It was during that time that she discovered Buddhism.</p><p id=par-4_18>During an interview with Oprah Winfrey&nbsp;published in<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>O, </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Oprah Magazine</a>, Turner explained how she began practicing it.</p><p id=par-5_64>“One day, someone told me, ‘Buddhism will save your life,'” she recalled. “I was willing to try anything. I started to chant. Once, I chanted, went to the studio, and put down a vocal, just like that. Ike was so excited that he gave me a big wad of money and said, ‘Go shopping!’ I thought, ‘This chanting stuff works.” I was hooked.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_49>She added, “I never close a door on any other religion. Most of the time, some part of it makes sense to me. I don’t believe everyone has to chant just because I chant. I believe all religion is about touching something inside of yourself. It’s all one thing.”</p><h2 id=h-turner-says-it-did-save-her-life>Turner says it did ‘save her life’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tina-Turner-smiles-during-photo-call-for-the-musical-Tina-Das-Tina-Turner-Musical-in-2018.jpg><p id=par-7_14>In the past, Turner has opened up about how she attempted suicide in 1968.</p><p id=par-8_74>“There were so many external circumstances and forces I couldn’t change or control, but my life-altering revelation was that I could change my way of responding to these challenges,” she wrote in her book Happiness Becomes You.&nbsp;“The most valuable help comes from within, and peace comes when individuals work on becoming their better selves. Here, I reveal my greatest untold life lessons, deepest realizations, and beloved ancient rituals to help you recharge your soul.”</p><p id=par-9_48>Turner practices the words “Nam-myoho-renge-kyo” and credits the wisdom of Buddhism with saving her life. “The more I learned&nbsp;about&nbsp;it, the more I found&nbsp;the philosophy&nbsp;helpful, and it&nbsp;made perfect sense to me,” she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard</a> in 2020.&nbsp;“Buddhism literally saved my life, and I’ve been happily chanting every day&nbsp;for&nbsp;about 50&nbsp;years now.”</p><p id=par-10_14>Turner worked with Tibetan Buddhists and&nbsp;in 2005 met the 14th&nbsp;Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso.</p><h2 id=h-tina-turner-s-early-life-and-career>Tina Turner’s early life and career</h2><p id=par-11_27>Turner was born Anna Mae Bullock on Nov. 26, 1939, in Nutbush, Tennessee to parents Floyd and Zelma Bullock. Turner was raised in a Baptist family.</p><p id=par-12_71>“I went to church every Sunday,” she told <a href=#>Lion’s </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Roar</a>. “The preachers were speaking the words of God, but I didn’t really hear what the preacher said. What affected me was the environment. It was the people’s “amen” in agreeing with the preacher. We had a young Baptist reunion to learn about the Bible and it put me in touch with information about God and Jesus and being nice to people.”</p><p id=par-13_29><strong>How to get help:</strong>&nbsp;In the U.S., call the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a>&nbsp;at 1-800-273-8255.
