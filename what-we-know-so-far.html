After 26 months [of negotiations] with Gage Edward Fredenburg — most of it was contentious, I would say — we have settled our custody agreement,” Lewis said (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a>). “His lawsuit against me has dropped. My lawsuit against him has been dropped. And we have come to an agreement about custody.”</p><p id=par-9_14>Lewis also revealed that he and Edward have “been getting along really, really well.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-was-flipping-out-canceled>Why was ‘Flipping Out’ canceled?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jenni-pulos-jeff-lewis-flipping-out.jpg><p id=par-10_61>Flipping Out came to an end in 2018 amid serious drama between Lewis’ and his co-star and employee Jenni Pulos.
