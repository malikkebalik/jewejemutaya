The king became enamored with Anne and would stop at nothing to have her. In 1527, Henry appealed to the catholic church for a divorce but was denied. Four years later, Henry decided that if the church would not grant him his divorce, he would become the church and grant it himself.</p><p id=par-4_52>Thus, in 1533, Henry created the Church of England, installed himself as the head of it (via the Act of Supremacy), and had his marriage to Katherine annulled, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Historic Royal Palaces</a>. By this time, he had already married Anne five months prior, but who was going to argue with him?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_39>Unsurprisingly, once Anne married the king, she became the subject of his wrath. Instead of producing the male heir that Henry sought, Anne produced a girl—Elizabeth (Katherine and Henry’s marriage had similarly produced only a single female heir, Mary).&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_32>By 1536, the Reformation Henry had begun to win Anne had led to Anne having many enemies at court. One of which was Thomas Cromwell, who leveled claims of adultery against her.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_33>Now looking for a way out of the marriage, Henry had Anne arrested, tried, and beheaded in short order. Eleven days later, Henry married the third of what would be his eight wives.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Netflix’s </strong><strong>‘Blood, Sex, and Royalty’ </strong><strong>cast and release date</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-8_48>Though much of the cast of Netflix’s Blood, Sex, and Royalty does not have characters assigned on its <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a> page, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hello Magazine</a> reports that Amy James-Kelly will be playing Anne Boleyn. James-Kelly is best known for her role as Suzannah Sowden (née Washington) on the series Gentleman Jack.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_31>Starring opposite her as the infamous King Henry VIII is Max Parker.

Following the trend set by other incredibly successful yet historically liberal series like Bridgerton and Persuasion, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Popsugar</a> says, “Netflix’s Blood, Sex & Royalty merges decked-out dramatizations with historical commentary.”</p><p id=par-13_29>Dr. Owen Emmerson and Lauren Mackay will be featured historians in the series.
