The show that made him famous was a reality show about pro skateboarder Rob Dyrdek's "Fantasy Factory," a giant structure that contains both an office building and the first indoor skate plaza made entirely from concrete. Scott is the younger brother of Dyrdek's cousin and Fantasy Factory fixture <a href=#>Chris Pfaff</a>, better known as "Drama." The elder Pfaff first came to prominence on Dyrdek's previous reality show project Rob & Big, on which he fell into the role of Dyrdek's hapless personal assistant who was often the butt of pranks or practical jokes. Since then, however, Pfaff has become a somewhat successful music producer who even has his own recording studio in the Fantasy Factory. And while Scott hasn't distinguished himself to the level of his older brother yet, he's managed to gain quite a following among fans of Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory as the show's resident skate technician.</p><p>He has also filled the role his big brother had previously in many ways, often serving as the butt of jokes directed at his "awkwardness" in dealing with people, among other things. Scott Pfaff appeared on Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory from 2009 to 2015 and also appeared in episodes of the TV series Ridiculousness and Nitro Circus. In 2010 he appeared in TV documentary 1000 Ways to Die. Pfaff was a clip producer for the series Ridiculousness from 2011 to 2013. He is the owner of the Born a Lion clothing line.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkwKS7061km6GXYrCiwIypnZqelmK7psCMsKarrJhk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mase-off-the-hook-for-35-000-in-jewelry.html><span>←</span><span>Mase Off The Hook For $35,000 In Jewelry</span></a>
