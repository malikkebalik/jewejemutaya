The Accepted star has sometimes even had accusations leveled at her that she’s been lying about her height.</p><p id=par-4_67>“It was ‘Blake tells a tall tale!’ – that’s I’m really 5 feet, 4 inches and I lie and say I’m really tall, but I have to be wearing stilts all the time. Our hair and make-up girl on Gossip Girl thought it was really funny, and she tacked it to the mirror,” Lively once told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Independent</a> when recalling the strangest story she’s heard about herself.</p><p id=par-5_26>Most publications agree that Lively is 5 feet, 10 inches tall. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celeb Heights</a>, it’s a claim that Lively might have made about herself personally.</p><p id=par-6_18>“First of all I’m not 5 feet, 2 inches, I am 5 feet, 10 inches,” Lively allegedly said.</p><p id=par-7_34>Celeb Heights, however, measures Lively at closer to 5 feet, 8 inches. The number was reached by the members of the Celeb Height community, who the majority feel is an accurate number for Lively.</p><h2 id=h-blake-lively-once-shared-she-sometimes-felt-like-a-man-because-of-her-height-insecurities>Blake Lively once shared she sometimes felt like a man because of her height insecurities</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_50>Whatever her true height may be, Lively has still spent her career towering over many of her peers. Some of this is because the <a href=#>Gossip Girl alum</a> occasionally wears high heels. In a 2009 interview with Allure (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E-News</a>), Lively admitted her height could sometimes be a source of insecurity.</p><p id=par-9_55>“I don’t know, I’m … large? They put me in six-inch heels, and I tower over every man. I’ve got this long hair and lots of clothes and makeup on. I just feel really big a lot of the time, and I’m surrounded by a lot of tiny people. I feel like a man sometimes.”</p><p id=par-10_28>But <a href=#>The Town star</a> wouldn’t have to worry about towering over Reynolds. Many publications, including Celeb Heights, are in agreement that her husband is 6 Ffeet, 2 inches.</p><h2 id=h-blake-lively-used-to-be-teased-in-school-because-of-her-height>Blake Lively used to be teased in school because of her height</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_69>Lively was also once a bit insecure about her height when she was a child. She often dealt with others teasing her because of how tall she was and calling her nicknames. But a picture the 35 year-old actor once posted online would indicate she made peace with her past. In the photo, Lively is standing next to Sesame Street’s Big Bird, which was a callback to her childhood.</p><p id=par-12_42>“Kids used to make fun of me in elementary school by calling me Big Bird (because I was ‘too tall’ and had ‘yellow’ hair). Here’s to making best buddies with the things that once hurt you,” she wrote on Instagram (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yahoo</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvra3KnmSloaaaubp50qGYq52UYsCwucStoKado2KzprjTZqOio5ViuqK6jKGcop%2BYqXqqutKemq6qmam2pr%2BNoaumpF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./16-and-pregnant-recap-4-14-14-season-5-premiere-maddy.html><span>←</span><span>16 and Pregnant RECAP 4/14/14: Season 5 Premiere Maddy</span></a>
