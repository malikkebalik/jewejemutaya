Shaquille O'Neal is one of the most dominant and iconic centers in the history of the NBA. Over his 19-year career, Shaq earned numerous accolades and achievements, including four NBA Championships, three NBA Finals MVP awards, and 15 All-Star selections. In addition to his prowess on the court, Shaq has also made a significant impact off the court, becoming a successful entrepreneur, television personality, and philanthropist.</p><p>Shaq's NBA journey began in 1992 when the Orlando Magic selected him as the first overall pick in the NBA Draft. He quickly made a name for himself, winning the NBA Rookie of the Year award and leading the Magic to the NBA Finals in just his third season. However, it was his tenure with the Los Angeles Lakers from 1996 to 2004 that cemented his legacy. Alongside <a href=# title="Kobe Bryant Net Worth">Kobe Bryant</a>, Shaq won three consecutive NBA Championships from 2000 to 2002 and earned the Finals MVP each time. Later in his career, Shaq secured his fourth championship ring with the Miami Heat in 2006.</p><p>Off the court, Shaquille O'Neal has been a marketing powerhouse, endorsing a wide range of products and brands throughout his career. His estimated career earnings from salary and endorsements exceed $800 million, making him one of the highest-paid athletes of all time. Some of his most notable endorsement deals include Reebok, Pepsi, Icy Hot, and Buick. During his NBA career, Shaq earned $292 million in salary alone. He earned well over $200 million from endorsements during that same time period. Even though he has been retired for many years, Shaq still earns around $60 million per year from endorsements and various business endeavors to this day.</p><p>Shaq's charisma and larger-than-life personality have also made him a beloved figure in the entertainment industry. He has appeared in numerous films and television shows, released rap albums, and currently serves as an analyst on the popular basketball show "Inside the NBA." Moreover, Shaq has built a successful investment portfolio, which includes ownership stakes in companies like Google, Papa John's, and a variety of franchise businesses.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Shaquille O'Neal was born on March 6th, 1972 in Newark, New Jersey to parents Lucille O'Neal and Joe Toney. His father was addicted to drugs and went to prison for drug possession when O'Neal was just a baby. His parents never married and his father left soon after Shaq was born, upon his release from prison. O'Neal was estranged from his father for decades. At the age of two, his mother married Phillip Harrison who was a sergeant in the U.S. Army. O'Neal was a part of the Boys and Girls Club of America while growing up and he credits the organization for helping to keep him off the streets. The family moved from Newark and moved around to Germany and Texas. While still in high school, Shaq started to gain attention for his basketball talent. In his senior year, he led the San Antonio's Robert G. Cole High School team to the state championship. O'Neal went on to Louisiana State University where he became a two-time SEC player of the year and a two-time All American. He also received the Adolph Rupp's Trophy for the NCAA men's basketball player of the year in 1991.</p><h2 id=nba-superstar><strong>NBA Superstar</strong></h2><p>In 1992 O'Neal became the first overall pick for the Orlando Magic. A year later he was named the Rookie of the Year and voted an All Star-starter which had not been accomplished since <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a>. In his second season, Shaq helped the Magic make their way to their first play-off series. The next year they made it to the finals, but lost to the Houston Rockets.</p><p>O'Neal was plagued by injury for a good deal of the 1995-96 season, though the Orlando Magic still finished the regular season with a winning record. In the playoffs that year, O'Neal and the Magic won the first two rounds but were ultimately defeated by Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls.</p><p>In 1996, O'Neal was part of the men's Olympic basketball team in Atlanta. That team went on to win the Olympic gold medal. It was during the Olympics that O'Neal announced his plans to join the Los Angeles Lakers as tensions rose amongst his coach, teammates and local Orlando Media. The Lakers offered O'Neal a seven year $121 million deal.</p><p>This move paired O'Neal with a teenaged Kobe Bryant, bringing two of the game's biggest names together on one team. However, while his first few years with the Lakers were promising, they failed to clinch a championship. O'Neal battled against injury and personnel changes until a change in leadership turned things around.</p><p>The arrival of former Chicago Bulls coach <a href=# title="Phil Jackson Net Worth">Phil Jackson</a> in the 1999-00 season set the Lakers on a path that would make them a dominant force for years to come. Jackson challenged O'Neal and led him to step up his defensive game. Shaquille and the Lakers won the NBA championship that year, and would go on to win the title the next two years in a row.</p><p>O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004. The following year, Shaq signed a 5-year contract with the team for $100 million. While he likely could have demanded more money, he stated that it was another championship that he was after. The team got their chance the very next year, as the Heat beat the Dallas Mavericks to clinch the team's first ever title and O'Neal's fourth.</p><p>Beginning in 2008, O'Neal's days of long-term contracts with teams had come to an end. That year he was traded to the Phoenix Suns where, for the first time since his rookie season, he failed to make the playoffs. At the end of his first season with the team, he was traded to free up the budget. More one-year stints would follow, including with the Cleveland Cavaliers (alongside Lebron James) and his final season with the Boston Celtics.</p><h2 id=player-profile><strong>Player Profile</strong></h2><p>Shaq stands at an astonishing 7 feet one inch and his shoe size is a remarkable 23. He became famous largely due to his physical stature, which gave him a distinct advantage over his opponents. On two occasions in his early NBA career, Shaq's overwhelmingly powerful dunks broke the steel backboard supports of the net. This prompted the league to increase the strength and stability of the backboards from then on. O'Neal is famous for his "drop step" move which he nicknamed the Black Tornado.</p><h2 id=shaquille-o8217neal-salary><strong>Shaquille O'Neal Salary</strong></h2><p>What was Shaquille O'Neal's peak salary? $27 million</p><p>Salary by year and team:</p><ul><li>1992-93 Orlando Magic $3,000,000</li><li>1993-94 Orlando Magic $3,900,000</li><li>1994-95 Orlando Magic $4,800,000</li><li>1995-96 Orlando Magic $5,700,000</li><li>1996-97 Los Angeles Lakers $10,714,000</li><li>1997-98 Los Angeles Lakers $12,857,143</li><li>1998-99 Los Angeles Lakers $15,000,000</li><li>1999-00 Los Angeles Lakers $17,142,858</li><li>2000-01 Los Angeles Lakers $19,285,715</li><li>2001-02 Los Angeles Lakers $21,428,572</li><li>2002-03 Los Angeles Lakers $23,571,429</li><li>2003-04 Los Angeles Lakers $24,749,999</li><li>2004-05 Miami Heat $27,696,430</li><li>2005-06 Miami Heat $20,000,000</li><li>2006-07 Miami Heat $20,000,000</li><li>2007-08 Phoenix Suns $20,000,000</li><li>2008-09 Phoenix Suns $21,000,000</li><li>2009-10 Cleveland Cavaliers $20,000,000</li><li>2010-11 Boston Celtics $1,352,181</li></ul><p>Total career NBA earnings = $292,198,327</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-297999 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Shaquille-ONeal.jpg alt width=900 height=678 sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-297999 class=wp-caption-text>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</p><p>In the early nineties, Shaq was quickly becoming a huge star, exploring careers in the rap and film industry, appearing in films such as "Blue Chips" and "Kazaam".

In November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy wiping out billions of dollars, including Shaq's personal stake in the company.</p><h2 id=endorsements><strong>Endorsements</strong></h2><p>Few athletes have embraced endorsements as fully as Shaquille O'Neal. As an instantly recognizable celebrity, a variety of companies have sought him out as a spokesperson. Some of his higher profile endorsements include Pepsi, Carnival Cruise Line and Reebok. A full list of Shaq's endorsement deals and commercial appearances would be too long to list.</p><h2 id=academic-achievements><strong>Academic Achievements</strong></h2><p>One of Shaquille O'Neal's other great accomplishments is that of gaining a doctoral degree in education. After receiving his masters degree from the University of Phoenix, O'Neal embarked on the course through the private Catholic institution, Barry University. The course was primarily completed online over a number of years, and reflected O'Neal's passion for education and his interest in continuing to challenge himself.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Shaq married Shaunie Nelson in December 2002. They have four children together: Shareef, Amirah, Shaqir, and Me'arah. Shaq also has a daughter, Taahirah, from a previous relationship with Arnetta Yardbourgh.
