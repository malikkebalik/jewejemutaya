Captain Pruitt Herrera (Miguel Sandoval) helped JJ deliver the baby during an intense blizzard. During the same episode, Pruitt told his daughter, Andy Herrera (Jaina Lee Ortiz), that his testicular cancer had metastasized, and he had six months to live.</p><p id=par-3_57>In the following&nbsp;Station 19&nbsp;Season 3 episodes, JJ leaves the baby with Dean, insisting that she won’t be a good mother. When Captain Pruitt came to help Dean with the baby, the firefighter decided to name the baby after him — Pruitt Arike Miller. Later, <a href=#>Vic Hughes (Barrett Doss) moved in with Dean</a> to help with the baby.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2><strong>‘Station 19’ Dean’s mother and father refused to meet his baby, Pruitt</strong></h2><p id=par-4_72>In&nbsp;Station 19&nbsp;Season 3 Episode 10, viewers found out why Dean Miller’s parents did not want to see his baby, Pruitt. In a conversation with grief counselor&nbsp;<a href=#>Diane Lewis (Tracie Thoms)</a>, Dean opened up about his parents. He explained to Diane and Vic that Pru’s middle name, Arike, is from his mother’s Nigerian tribe. That’s why in the&nbsp;<a href=#>Nov. 18 episode</a>, Dean’s father, Bill Miller (Jeffrey D. Sams), called Pru by her middle name, Arike.</p><p id=par-5_49>Then he admitted that his mother, Ifeya Miller (Barbara Eve Harris), wouldn’t meet Pru because they had the “baby out of wedlock.” He disappointed his parents, and they cut him off financially and emotionally. Dean also added that his mother felt crushed and shamed when he became a firefighter.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>‘Station 19’ fans do not want Pru’s grandparents to have custody</strong></h2><p id=par-6_44>In the&nbsp;<a href=#>Station 19&nbsp;Season 5 Episode 7 promo</a>, Miranda insists she does not want to rip Pru away from her grandparents.
