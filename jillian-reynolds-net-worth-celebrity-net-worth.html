She was adopted as an infant and was a victim of sexual abuse during her youth. With the help of a private detective, Reynolds found her biological parents as an adult and learned that she has two sisters. She told "People" magazine in 2009 that she's close to both her biological and adoptive families, adding, "When I spoke with my birth father for the first time, he told me I had sisters – not just half-sisters, but full sisters, since he and my mom had ended up marrying and raising a family. It was a wonderful story. I've been very blessed in that respect. They're great people." Jillian attended Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario, and she earned a diploma from the school's two-year broadcast journalism program. Reynolds then worked at several TV stations, such as Montreal's The Weather Network, L.A.'s KTTV, and Miami's WSVN.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 2000, Jillian was hired by Fox Sports to present the weather on Fox NFL Sunday's pre-game show, and there, she worked alongside <a href=# title="Terry Bradshaw Net Worth">Terry Bradshaw</a>, <a href=# title="Howie Long Net Worth">Howie Long</a>, and <a href=# title="James Brown Net Worth">James Brown</a>.

Reynolds said of the experience, "Getting fired like that was horrible and humbling. I was told I'd be paid out of my contract but couldn't say that I was fired. I slipped a couple of times because I'm not a good liar. But it was hard."</p><p>She was an entertainment and weather reporter for Fox Sports during the Super Bowl in 2002, 2005, and 2008, and she co-hosted Fox's "New Years Eve Live 2006" with <a href=# title="Regis Philbin Net Worth">Regis Philbin</a>.

In November 2020, Jillian was honored as one of "Amaré Magazine's" Heroes of Change. In July 2022, Reynolds revealed on Instagram that she was ten months sober, writing, "Almost at the year mark when I will celebrate. I'm grateful. I'm peaceful. I'm reflective.
