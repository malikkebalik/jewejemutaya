An adaption of the book of the same name and a pseudo-remake of the classic John Cusack film, the show stars Zoë Kravitz as the curmudgeonly record store owner Rob. She explores her feelings about a recent breakup and many past relationships through the music in her shop.</p><p id=par-2_22>Among the many questions the series’ abrupt demise left unanswered, one stands out as the most esoteric: How tall is Zoë Kravitz?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-zo-kravitz-is-relatively-short>Zoë Kravitz is relatively short</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Zoe-Kravitz-2021-Met-Gala.jpg><p id=par-3_27>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>, Kravitz stands 5 feet 2 inches tall. It’s a bit hard to imagine, given her commanding onscreen presence, but that’s the official measurement.</p><p id=par-4_19>Her loftier appearance is partly thanks to camera tricks that make her seem taller than her actual height.</p><p id=par-5_24>That said, the truth is apparent whenever she stands next to <a href=#>her stepfather, Jason Momoa</a>, who towers over her at 6 feet 4 inches.</p><p id=par-6_43>As for other interesting trivia, probably the most relevant to High Fidelity is her family. Funnily enough, Lisa Bonet, Kravitz’s mother, appeared in the 2000 film&nbsp;High Fidelity. It’s a wild coincidence that no doubt makes fans of the movie feel that much older.</p><p id=par-7_21>Also, coincidentally, Kravitz is the same height as her mom. And <a href=#>Lenny Kravitz, Zoë’s famous rocker dad</a>, is 5 foot 9.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-zo-kravitz-s-career-includes-a-slew-of-great-roles>Zoë Kravitz’s career includes a slew of great roles</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_66>Kravitz’s career has been a wild ride, even in her early years. After a short period of bit parts and minor roles in films like Assassination of a High School President&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Greatest, her first big break came as a lead in&nbsp;2010’s Beware the Gonzo. Though only tepidly received, the film’s premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival was a good indication Kravitz was a yet-undiscovered talent.</p><p id=par-9_7>From there, her roles only grew bigger.</p><p id=par-10_53>In 2011, she starred in&nbsp;Yelling to the Sky, an indie darling about the complex relationships in an abusive family living in a bad neighborhood. Kravitz delivered a powerhouse performance (as did the rest of the cast), more than proving her as one of the best up-and-coming actors of the past several years.</p><p id=par-11_34>After that, she performed in a bevy of films, including X-Men: First Class, After Earth, Good Kill, Mad Max: Fury Road, and the&nbsp;Divergent franchise. She also appeared in the TV series&nbsp;Californication, Portlandia,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Big Little Lies.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-has-some-exciting-upcoming-projects>She has some exciting upcoming projects</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-12_72>Kravitz has worked on several exciting projects set to release soon. For starters, she’ll star in the new Steven Soderbergh film, Kimi, where an agoraphobic tech worker happens upon evidence of a violent crime and must leave her apartment to try to bring the criminals to justice. A chilling, politically charged thriller set during the COVID-19 pandemic, the film is sure to show off her range à la her early indie work.</p><p id=par-13_45>Additionally, Kravitz has signed on to appear in Matt Reeves’&nbsp;The Batman as the thief and occasional supervillain Selina Kyle — aka Catwoman. It’s a role the actor has technically played before, having voiced the character for a few lines in 2017’s&nbsp;The Lego Batman Movie.</p><p id=par-14_29>And plans are already in the works for her own Catwoman film series. So it’s a good bet Kravitz will steal the show even when <a href=#>performing opposite Robert Pattinson</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1qrPHZp2inJWhtrXFjKGmsGWklrmtecisZLOnlWK4s63VoquzZpipuq17</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./harry-dean-stanton-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Harry Dean Stanton Net Worth</span></a>
