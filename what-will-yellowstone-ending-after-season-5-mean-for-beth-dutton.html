Though appalled, Beth suggested to John that maybe it’s time for Jamie to visit the train station as well. Meanwhile, Jamie is expecting his sister to act on this new knowledge, so he contracts Sarah to take care of his problem.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>While there’s no telling what showrunner Taylor Sheridan has planned for the remaining episodes of Yellowstone, we do know that some cast members will be making it to the sequel series, which is rumored to feature Matthew McConaughey as the new lead.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>That means it’s entirely plausible for Kelly Reilly to reprise her role as Beth in the next show, but while there’s a great deal of uncertainty at this stage, one thing is absolutely certain; there isn’t enough room in Montana for both Jamie and Beth, so it’s highly likely that one will end up murdering the other before this is over.</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false>Barring the scant likelihood that both survive the ending, the only question that remains is if Jamie will be successful in his attempt to get rid of his adoptive sister.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZLChnKF6urHLpaawq6Sku6Z5xKeboqaXYq6nwMSrZKydkai8r3mUZqSemZ5is7C%2BjJucraBdmcK1wM6nZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./valyantsin-byalkevich-biograf%C3%ADa-edad-altura-esposo-net-worth-familia.html><span>←</span><span>Valyantsin Byalkevich biografa, edad, altura, esposo, net worth, familia</span></a>
