One particular property featured on 'Hoarders' has made headlines for its transformation, but the journey from a cluttered foreclosure to a luxury rental location wasn't an easy one.

One particular property featured on the show has made headlines for its transformation, but the journey from a cluttered foreclosure to a luxury rental location wasn’t an easy one.</p><h2 id=h-the-julian-price-house-was-featured-on-hoarders>The Julian Price house was featured on ‘Hoarders’&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_64>While many are drawn to the <a href=#>voyeuristic nature of&nbsp;Hoarders</a>, there is also an element of assistance and treatment to the program. The series has always walked the line between shock value and sympathy, and it hasn’t always been easy to strike a balance. The series has seen numerous cancellations and resurgences over the years, and it has left some shocking tales in its wake.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_98>One of those involves the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julian Price House</a>, which is a 1929 Tudor mansion on 1.6 acres in Greensboro, North Carolina. The gorgeous property had fallen into disrepair while in the hands of a former interior designer named Sandra Cowart, who found herself overwhelmed by the home’s 31 rooms. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The List</a> reports, Cowart “had filled the entire space” and was struggling to keep up with the mortgage on the sprawling estate. When the bank foreclosed, she lost her home and left behind <a href=#>quite a mess for the new owners</a> — including “trash, mold, and large furniture items.”&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-julian-price-house-was-transformed-into-a-bed-and-breakfast>The Julian Price house was transformed into a Bed and Breakfast</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_52>Many followed along on the home’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> page to see the space transformed into a luxurious rental. The fate of the property was in limbo with a legal dispute over whether it could be turned into an Airbnb. Ultimately, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Greensboro News</a>, a judge ruled that it could become a luxury rental.</p><p id=par-6_56>Today, the bed and breakfast gets tremendous reviews from guests and multiple suites that can be rented out individually. The Blue Room, for instance, rents for around $175 a night and features a ceiling painted like a sunny sky filled with puffy white clouds. The Traveler’s Room features an antique French dresser and overlooks the gardens.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_51>Those who have a large party can choose to rent the entire living space. Up to nine guests are invited to stay in the residential home for around $1000 a night. Those needing even more space — say, for a wedding or other special event — can rent the entire estate.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-julian-price-house-is-on-the-national-register-of-historic-places>The Julian Price house is on the National Register of Historic Places</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Hoarders-TLC.jpeg><p id=par-8_45>Adding to the charm and transformation story of the Julian Price house is that this home is on the National Register of Historic Places. The home once belonged to philanthropist Julian Price, who developed an insurance company that would eventually become a Fortune 500 company.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_85>As the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Triad Business Journal</a> reports, Price’s home was designed by architect Charles Hartmann in 1928. It’s located in what today is a historic neighborhood known as Fisher Park. This designation caused some trouble for the developers who wanted to make it a rental as those in the neighborhood were concerned about disruptions from parking and frequent guests. When the planning and zoning department for the city recommended approval for the property, a hurdle was cleared. Now, the property boasts gorgeous decor and five-star reviews.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sK3RnZyrq12lv7C8xKursmWnlsBuwNSrpZ6cXZ67tbuMmmSlraiqv6q71Kxkm52UYq6vsIybqZ6Zm5uutMCNoaumpF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./7-ways-drake-should-have-reacted-to-that-lap-dance-in-nicki-minaj-s-anaconda-video.html><span>←</span><span>7 Ways Drake Should Have Reacted to That Lap Dance in Nicki Minaj's &amp;quot;Anaconda&amp;quot; Video</span></a>
