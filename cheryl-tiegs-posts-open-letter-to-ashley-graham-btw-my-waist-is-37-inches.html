Graham is currently one of the most popular and sought-after plus-sized models, “plus-sized” meaning that she looks like she’s about a size 16 or 18 in American (non-vanity) sizing. As I said in my original post, the E! News reporter threw out a gentle softball question to Tiegs and she just utterly screwed it up and offended everyone when she said: “Actually I don’t like that we’re talking about full-figured women because it’s glamorizing them and your waist should be smaller than 35 [inches]. That’s what Dr. Oz said, and I’m sticking to it. No, I don’t think it’s healthy.” As we learned yesterday, Ashley Graham had some thoughts too –<a href=#>she slapped back at Tiegs a little bit</a>, but her attitude was more “this perspective is prevalent in the fashion industry, so things need to change.” Anyway, Tiegs has now written a short statement on HuffPo, addressed to Ashley Graham (I made some minor edits for space):</p><p>Dear Ashley,</p><p>Here is the question that was asked of me: “Do you love the fact that we are actually stepping outside our comfort zone of what we know is like the model figure and we are actually using full figured women and making that a thing now?”</p><p>This was a generic question, and I said that I did not love it. My answer was based on health concerns because of our nation’s increasing problems with weight linked to diabetes, heart issues and cancer. At no time was I thinking of a specific person.</p><p>What has ensued is yet another “manufactured media feud” that is needed to feed websites and empty air time.</p><p>I was not equating beauty to weight or size, but unfortunately that is what the media reported in headlines. I was trying to express my concern over media images and the lack of education in America about healthy choices, thus the reference to the 35-inch waist as a guideline to health. I did hear that on Dr. Oz, but it’s also stated on websites such as The Center For Disease Control, Harvard University and The American Diabetes Association.</p><p>And by the way, my waist is 37 inches.</p><p>I worry about the influence that print media has on this issue and I care about the health of all Americans. If it becomes the norm, then what happens with rates of diabetes, cancer and heart disease? This has nothing to do with beauty.</p><p>Please accept my deepest apology if you were offended or in any way think I was referring to you. I commend you on the positive influence you have on helping women to love themselves. I care about health and longevity for everyone.</p><p>Sincerely, Cheryl Tiegs</p><p><a href=#>[From HuffPo]</a></p><p>While I originally thought Cheryl Tiegs was a drunk, out-of-touch lady who needed to sit down, now I kind of hate her. This was not a “manufactured” feud. I even included the video of the E! interview <a href=#>in my original post</a>, and the E! reporter was clearly name-checking and referencing Ashley Graham, and Cheryl clearly said that she’s not down for the “glamorization” of full-figured women or anyone with a waist bigger than 35 inches. I also feel like the whole “BUT THINK ABOUT THE HEALTH CONCERNS” argument is both tedious and concern-trolly. And like Ashley said in her response yesterday, “There are too many people thinking they can look at a girl my size and say that we are unhealthy. You can’t, only my doctor can!” Thin does not equal healthy, and Size 16 does not equal unhealthy.</p><p>Also, the “I’m sorry you were offended” thing needs to stop. Just say you were sorry, full-stop.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/wenn23520319.jpg alt=wenn23520319 width=480 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/wenn23518447.jpg alt=wenn23518447 width=490 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbW9kaYF2e8KhnKuxnJTBqrHGrJawqpmpsrSrzqmcp5ecmsG1sdGYq6iXkai1rbHYmJ6rmZiWuqCu2JiroZ2PrK66q8yylrCZmajBoLXSmGpwl5mjsKmx0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./captain-marvel-star-brie-larson-reveals-why-she-avoids-met-gala-bathrooms-at-all-costs.html><span>←</span><span>'Captain Marvel' Star Brie Larson Reveals Why She Avoids MET Gala Bathrooms at All Costs</span></a>
