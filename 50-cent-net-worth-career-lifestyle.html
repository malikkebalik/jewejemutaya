During this time, he was already pursuing his business endeavors which profited him astonishingly.&nbsp;</p><p>However, his yearly income slowly decreased from that point, with average annual earnings of <strong>$4 to $5 million</strong>.</p><h3>Bankruptcy</h3><p>Curtis currently has a net worth of around <strong>$40 million</strong>, a massive drop from his peak net worth of <strong>$150 million.</strong></p><p>Even though he filed for bankruptcy in 2015, it was believed that the decision was purely intentional to get himself out of paying millions of dollars.</p><p>Compared with other artists in the music industry, 50 Cent had a short time in the limelight and still managed to earn a massive fortune and worldwide recognition.</p><h2>Net Worth of 50 Cent in Different Currencies</h2><p>50 Cent’s net worth as of December 2023 is a staggering<strong> $40 million</strong>, and the following data shows how much it is worth in some of the major currencies globally, including crypto.</p><table width=680><tbody><tr><td><strong>Currency</strong></td><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Euro</strong></td><td>€ 37.89 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pound Sterling</strong></td><td>£ 32.62 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Australian Dollar</strong></td><td>A$ 57.55 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Canadian Dollar</strong></td><td>C$ 51.79 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Indian Rupee</strong></td><td>₹ 3,124,380,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitcoin</strong></td><td>฿ 1,898.01</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class=wp-block-heading>50 Cent | House, & Cars</h2><h3>Houses</h3><p>For a rapper who has a <strong>$40 million</strong> net worth, it’s no surprise that he has a lavish mansion.</p><p>He once owned the infamous <a href=#>Tyson</a> mansion in Connecticut. The mansion featured 17 acres of Connecticut landscape and boasted over 53,000 square feet of living space.</p><p>The rapper had bought this estate in 2004 for a price of<strong> $4.1 million.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/50CentManions.jpg><p>50 initially put the mansion on sale for <strong>$18.5 million</strong> in 2007.</p><p>However, with no interested buyers, it remained on the market for more than ten years until 2019, when a businessman from Florida bought the compound for <strong>$2.9 million.</strong></p><p>Because of the size of the property and the land, it sat on, it was tough to maintain. The house typically cost over <strong>$50,000</strong> per month to maintain.</p><p>50 Cent currently lives in Houston, but he has not revealed the specification of his house.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cars&nbsp;</h3><p>Rapper 50 Cent has owned numerous luxurious automobiles over the years.</p><p>His first car ever was a Toyota Land Cruiser, but when success came running to him in music and businesses, he kept on adding more advanced and luxurious toys to his collection.</p><p>His collection once housed cars such as&nbsp;Lamborghini Murcielago worth <strong>$350,000</strong>,&nbsp;Ferrari F50 worth <strong>$2 million</strong>,&nbsp;Mercedes Maybach Vision 6 worth <strong>$2.5 million</strong>, and Maserati MC12 worth <strong>$1.5 million.</strong></p><p>Similarly, he maintains a fleet of exotic cars that includes Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano worth <strong>$300,000,&nbsp;</strong>Ferrari FF worth <strong>$300,000,</strong>&nbsp;Bentley Mulsanne worth <strong>$4,00,000, </strong>Ferrari 488 worth <strong>$330,000</strong>,&nbsp;Rolls-Royce Cullinan worth <strong>$325,000</strong> and&nbsp;Rolls-Royce Dawn Convertible worth <strong>$356,500.</strong></p><p><strong>Read About <a href=# rel=bookmark>Common’s Net Worth: Career & Lifestyle</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>50 Cent | Lifestyle</h2><p>Curtis went to Andrew Jackson High School but got arrested for possession and selling of drugs.&nbsp;</p><p>When he was 19 years old, an undercover police officer arrested him for selling cocaine, and three weeks later, when his house was raided, police found heroin and crack and <strong>$15,000</strong> in cash.</p><p>However, he still went back to dealing but knew his luck would run out eventually. It was time for a radical change of plan.</p><p>Inspired by rappers who turned their greedy street stories into cold-hearted cash Curtis came up with new hustle.</p><p>In 1996, he had a chance to meet with one of Run DMC members at a Manhattan nightclub. Curtis recorded a rough demo track for Jam Master Jay.</p><p>The track was raw but very real. Seeing the potential, Jam Master Jay signed Curtis to his label, and just like that 21-year-old small-time crack dealer had a new career.</p><p>He named himself “50 Cent” as a metaphor for change. And even bigger change came to his life a year later when 22 years old Cent and his girlfriend, Shaniqua Tomkins, had a baby boy, Marquise Jackson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/50Cent-1-scaled.jpg><p>50 Cent knows how to hustle and make money, but he also makes sure to spend his riches on the things he loves.</p><p>The rapper-turned entrepreneur boasts quite an impressive collection of expensive jewelry and iced-out timepieces.</p><p>It’s been reported that 50 Cent’s collection of jewelry and watches are worth a little more than <strong>$3 million.</strong></p><p>The most iconic jewelry of all is his G-Unit spinner chain which has an estimated value of <strong>$75,000.</strong></p><p>Similarly, his collection of watches includes Krieger, Audemars Piguet, and Richard Mille 1103.</p><p>50 Cent’s net worth as of December 2023 is a whopping <strong>$40 million</strong>.</p><p><strong>Read About <a href=# rel=bookmark>Akon’s Net Worth: Music Career & Investments</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>50 Cent | Charity Works</h2><p>Despite his badass persona, 50 Cent is a kindhearted individual who helps underprivileged people and supports several charities.</p><p>In 2003, he established G-Unit Foundation along with his group.</p><p>It is a non-profit foundation that focuses on improving the quality of life for low-income and underserved communities across the United States.</p><p>After selling his Farmington Mansion, 50 Cent donated a whopping <strong>$2.9 million</strong> to the G-Unit foundation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>50 Cent | Career</h2><p>Curtis Jackson, a small-time drug dealer from Queens, New York, became a recognized rapper after being discovered by Eminem and Dr. Dre in 2002.</p><p>Eminem was so astonished by the 50’s track “Guess Who’s Back?” that he invited Jackson to LA to meet Dr. Dre. 50 signed a <strong>$1 million</strong> record deal and released “No Mercy, No Fear.”&nbsp;</p><p>Jackson gained massive popularity after releasing his debut album “Get Rich or Die Trying.” It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard charts and sold more than a million copies in its first four days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Once the richest rapper in the whole world, his bank accounts took hits several times over the years.</p><p>In 2007, he had an estimated net worth of <strong>$150 million</strong>, which later plunged and left him nearly broke.
