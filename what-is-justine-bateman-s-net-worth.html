Recently, she wrote a book about her highs and lows with fame called Fame: The Hijacking of Reality in hopes of bringing to light the challenges of becoming famous.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_20>In an interview with <a href=#>Fast Company</a>, Bateman opened up about leaving film to go to college in her late ’40s.</p><p id=par-7_75>“The concept that my partners and I had was to film regular shows for strictly Internet distribution,” she explains. “I kept hearing, ‘You’re four years ahead,’ which I didn’t understand because all the technology was there. I had the whole plan. I had all the people who could do these things with me. All I needed was the check. So I just bottomed out on it and thought, ‘Fuck it. I’ll go the tech route.'”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-her-fame-and-success>Her fame and success</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_48>Nearly everyone knows Bateman for her role as the boy-crazy and shopping-obsessed Mallory on Family Ties, but there were other ventures before she took a break from Hollywood to go to college. Before being cast into her iconic role, she did modeling and commercials for a brief moment.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_38>Since her role, she has appeared on Arrested Development as Nellie, played Lisa Temple in Another Woman, Robin in Terror in the Night, and a brief appearance on the hit series <a href=#>Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior</a> as Margaret McKenna.</p><p id=par-10_23>Mostly, she’s been dabbling in production, taking on a more behind-the-scenes role in films like Violet, Five Minutes, and the 2017 Short PUSH.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_20>Shortly after being cast in Family Ties, Bateman opened up to <a href=#>CBC </a>on the moments leading up to being chosen.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_62>“I was doing modeling, and I didn’t want to get into that. I was doing plays at school, but I didn’t want to get into acting because of school, modeling — it was too much,” the young star said in 1983. “I did some commercials, and this [Family Ties] was the second theatrical interview, and I got it. I was really lucky.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-justine-bateman-s-net-worth>Justine Bateman’s net worth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-13_22>According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, “Justine Bateman is an American actress, writer, and producer who has a net worth of $5 million.”</p><p id=par-14_51>The number is considerably high for many fans, but it’s significantly lower than her younger brother <a href=#>Jason Bateman’s net worth</a>. This is likely due to the Family Ties actor shying away from the limelight to explore tech school while her brother steadily took on high-grossing movies and iconic roles in Hollywood.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSzornIpbBmrJmawG621KyroqaVYq%2BiwMSmmKdlnprBbsPOq6uhZpipuq17</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-watch-the-arrowverse-on-netflix-in-chronological-order.html><span>←</span><span>How To Watch The Arrowverse On Netflix In Chronological Order</span></a>
