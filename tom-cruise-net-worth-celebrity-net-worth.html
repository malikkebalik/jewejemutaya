Tom Cruise is generally considered one of the biggest stars in Hollywood history. He is also one of the highest-paid and <a href=#>richest celebrities in the world</a>. As of this writing, Tom Cruise movies have earned $11.5 billion at the global box office. Interestingly though, for most of his career none of Tom's films ever grossed over $1 billion. Prior to June 2022, his highest-grossing movie of all time was 2018's "Mission: Impossible – Fallout" which made $800 million globally. Tom finally hit the billion dollar mark in late June 2022, thanks to "Top Gun: Maverick," which ultimately went on to earn $1.5 billion globally.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Thomas Cruise Mapother IV was born on July 3, 1962 in Syracuse, New York. His father and namesake was an electrical engineer, his mother was a special ed teacher. Tom has three sisters. His first cousin William Mapother, would later also become an actor and has appeared alongside Tom in a number of projects.</p><p>Tom Cruise spent his early years moving around the country, with a brief stint in Canada after his father landed a job with the Canadian Armed Forces. Tom would later claim that his father was a bully who beat Tom and his siblings. He attended 15 schools in 14 years.</p><p>Tom didn't always dream of pursuing an acting career. Though he did take drama classes in middle school, he was more of a jock in middle school. He pivoted to acting in high school after a knee injury forced him off the wrestling team. Cruise devoted himself to the drama club and quickly won the lead role in their production of Guys and Dolls.</p><p>Despite receiving positive reviews and encouragement of his acting chops, Tom still wasn't interested. He actually spent a period at the St. Francis Seminary in Cincinnati hoping to become a Franciscan priest. He was expelled from seminary school for drinking.</p><p>Tom graduated from Glen Ridge High School in New Jersey in 1980.</p><h2 id=early-career><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p>After high school, Cruise initially moved to New York City to become an actor. He soon moved to Los Angeles to try out for television roles.</p><p>In 1981 Tom made his film debut with a small part in "Endless Love." That same year he earned critical praise for his role in "Taps." That role also led Tom to being signed by the powerhouse talent agency CAA. A CAA agent named Paula Wagner made the case for Tom directly to the agency's managing partner, <a href=# title="Michael Ovitz Net Worth">Michael Ovitz</a>. Not only would Tom go on to be a lifelong CAA client, in the early 1990s, Tom and Paula would form a production company called Cruise/Wagner Productions.</p><p>Tom earned further acclaim with "The Outsiders."</p><h2 id=success><strong>Success</strong></h2><p>In 1983, Tom had a star-making performance in the comedy/drama "Risky Business." Risky Business earned $64 million on a budget of $6 million and spawned a number of cultural touchstones. The movie secured Cruise as an up and coming star and earned him his first Golden Globe nomination.</p><p>Tom Cruise became one of the most-famous actors on the planet with the enormous sucess of 1986's "Top Gun." Top Gun grossed $360 million worldwide and was the highest-grossing film of the year.</p><p>That same year he appeared alongside <a href=# title="Paul Newman Net Worth">Paul Newman</a> in "The Color of Money."</p><p>The hits kept coming with "Cocktail" and "Rainman," both of which were released in 1988. Rain Man won four Academy Awards. Cruise's first Oscar nomination came a year later with"Born on the Fourth of July."</p><p>He followed with 1990's "Days of Thunder," 1992's "Far and Away," 1992's "A Few Good Men," 1993's "The Firm," and 1994's "Interview with the Vampire." For A Few Good Men, he received a Golden Globe nomination.</p><p>In 1996 Tom Cruise simultaneously starred in and produced the blockbuster hit "Mission: Impossible," which grossed worldwide at $457 million and produced several successful sequels. This same year Tom starred in another cultural phenomenon, "Jerry Maguire," which earned $275 million on a $50 million budget and resulted in a Best Actor Oscar nomination. His co-star Cuba Gooding, Jr. won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.</p><p>Tom continued to pump out hits over the next decade+.

He earned $75 million for Mission Impossible 3.</p><p>Tom's two highest-paid movies to date are 2000's Mission Impossible 2 and 2005's War of the Worlds. He earned $100 million from EACH movie thank to lucrative backend points. When you look at a list of the <a href=#>10 largest acting paychecks</a> of all time (for a single movie), Tom Cruise ranks three times. His previously mentioned $100 million paydays are the third and fourth largest paydays behind <a href=# title="Bruce Willis Net Worth">Bruce Willis</a>' $105 million Sixth Sense payday and <a href=# title="Keanu Reeves Net Worth">Keanu Reeves</a>' $156 million Matrix payday.</p><p>Between 1983 and 2011 Tom earned $445 million in movie salaries. Between 2011 and 2019, he likely earned at least another $300 million, bringing his total career earnings (salary and bonuses) between 1983 and 2019, to <strong>$745 million</strong>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-242795 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GettyImages-136007626.jpg alt width=900 height=715 sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-242795 class=wp-caption-text>Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images</p><h2 id=top-gun-salary-earnings><strong>Top Gun Salary/Earnings</strong></h2><p>As we mentioned a moment ago, Tom Cruise's salary for 1986's "Top Gun" was $2 million. After adjusting for inflation, that the same as around $5.4 million today. Believe it or not, $2 million was 13% of Top Gun's entire $15 million budget. During the filming of Top Gun, a Tom Cruise-starring movie called "Legend" bombed at the box office, rendering producers <a href=# title="Jerry Bruckheimer Net Worth">Jerry Bruckheimer</a> and Don Simpson terrified. Fortunately, Top Gun was a smash-hit and went on to be the highest-grossing movie of 1986 with $360 million in revenue.</p><p>Fast forward three decades to 2018/2019. After many years of whispers, rumors and hopes from fans, a Top Gun sequel was finally produced thanks largely to producer David Ellison, son of <a href=# title="Larry Ellison Net Worth">Larry Ellison</a> and founder of Skydance. When David Ellison, a huge childhood fan of Top Gun and a pilot himself, founded Skydance in 2006 the FIRST movie he wanted to make was a Top Gun sequel. When the stars finally aligned, Skydance committed 25% of the film's roughly $200 million budget.</p><p>"Top Gun: Maverick" was initially supposed to be released in the middle of 2020, but had to be delayed for two years due to COVID. Tom is both the star and primary producer of the sequel. His base salary for Top Gun: Maverick was $13 million. More importantly, as producer Tom is entitled to 10 – 20% of the film's "first dollar" gross revenue. That's a deal no other star in Hollywood can secure. First dollar gross is paid out after movie theaters, known as exhibitors, take 40% of receipts, but before all other studio costs including marketing and production.</p><p>If Top Gun: Maverick grosses $1 billion at the box office and Tom owns 10% of first dollar gross, he'll earn around $60 million. If he has 20%, he'll make around $120 million. If he has 20% and when you include streaming sales down the road, it is very possible that <a href=#>Tom will earn around $200 million</a> which would be approximately 100x his original Top Gun salary.</p><h2 id=tom-cruise-height><strong>Tom Cruise Height</strong></h2><p>How tall is Tom Cruise? Tom Cruise is 5 foot 7 inches tall. He is three inches shorter than ex-wife <a href=# title="Nicole Kidman Net Worth">Nicole Kidman</a> (who is 5 foot 10) and two inches shorter than ex-wife Katie Holmes (who is 5 foot 9).</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-307629 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tom-cruise2.jpg alt width=900 height=611 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-307629 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by John Phillips/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Tom has been married several times He was married to actress <a href=# title="Mimi Rogers Net Worth">Mimi Rogers</a> from 1987 to 1990. It was Mimi who actually introduced Tom to Scientology.</p><p>Tom was married to Nicole Kidman from 1990 to 2001.</p><p>He was married to <a href=#>Katie Holmes</a> from 2006 to 2012.</p><h2 id=katie-holmes-divorce-settlement><strong>Katie Holmes Divorce Settlement</strong></h2><p>Tom and Katie's union produced one daughter, Suri. According to reports around the time of their divorce, Tom went into the marriage with a net worth of $250 million while Katie's net worth was less than $10 million. With much more to protect, Tom insisted on having a rock solid prenuptial agreement. The terms of their divorce required Tom to pay Katie $400,000 per year in child support for 12 years (until the year 2024). That's $33,000 per month, a total of $4.8 million when it's all said and done. Tom also must pay for Suri's medical expenses, education, insurance and any extra curricular activities. Katie has full-custody of Suri and has chosen to not raise their daughter with Scientology. Katie did NOT receive any form of spousal support or lump sum cash payment. It has been reported that Katie opted not to seek a dime in spousal support in order to receive full custody and control of Suri's upbringing.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-264852 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tom-1.jpg alt width=594 height=476 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-264852 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>Tom owns and has owned a number of extremely impressive properties around the US over the years.</p><p>In 2013 Tom sold a 10th floor condo in New York City's East Village for $3 million.</p><p>In September 2015 he sold a multi-residence property in the Hollywood Hills for $11.4 million. The buyer was <a href=# title="Eva Longoria Net Worth">Eva Longoria</a>.</p><p>In May 2016, Tom sold his longtime Beverly Hills estate to billionaire financier <a href=# title="Leon Black Net Worth">Leon Black</a> for $40 million. He purchased the house for $30.5 million in 2006 when he was still married to Katie Holmes.</p><p>In the mid 1990s when he was married to Nicole Kidman, Tom built a large mansion in Telluride, Colorado. His Telluride property spans 320 acres. The main home is 10,000 square feet with seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms, horse stables and a private helipad. He spent years lobbying the local airport to expand its runway so larger private jets could arrive. His runway wish was granted in 2010. In 2016 he listed this home for $59 million but ultimately did not find a buyer. He listed the home again in 2018 and again did not find a buyer. He re-listed the home in March 2021 for $39.5 million. Tom finally sold the property in May 2021 for exactly $39.5 million.</p><p>Here is a video tour from a prior listing:</p><p></p><p>In 2018 he spent $11.8 million buying multiple units in a condo complex in Clearwater, Florida, near the world headquarters of the Church of Scientology.</p><h2 id=cruise-wagner-productions><strong>Cruise/Wagner Productions</strong></h2><p>A major reason Tom has become an extraordinarily wealthy actor, as opposed to a merely very rich actor, is that he has produced many of his own films. In 1993 he and <a href=#>Paula Wagner</a> co-founded Cruise/Wagner Productions. To date their films have produced $3 billion worldwide. For many years their company had an exclusive deal with Paramount. That deal dissolved in 2006 after Tom's controversial statements about psychiatry and anti-depressants went viral and ruffled feathers around the industry. Funding ever since has been provided by hedge funds and Washington Redskins founder <a href=# title="Dan Snyder Net Worth">Dan Snyder</a>. In 2006 Paula and Tom were recruited by United Artists to revive the struggling studio. Though Paula left UA in 2008, today she and Tom still own 30% of the studio.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZMGwuYycqa6ho5p6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-music-to-ring-in-the-new-year.html><span>←</span><span>New Music to Ring In the New Year</span></a>
