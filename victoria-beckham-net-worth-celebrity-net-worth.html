That is a combined net worth with her husband, <a href=#>David Beckham</a>. In the late 1990s, Beckham rose to fame with the all-female pop group the Spice Girls and was dubbed Posh Spice by the July 1996 issue of the British music magazine "Top of the Pops." After the Spice Girls split, she was signed to Virgin Records and Telstar Records and had four UK Top 10 singles.</p><p>Victoria Beckham has proven that there is life after pop stardom.&nbsp; She burst onto the collective consciousness as one part of the cultural phenomenon known as he Spice Girls.&nbsp; Nicknamed "Posh Spice", by the British press, the singer quickly gained legions of fans, and her pouty poses and fashion choices were mimicked by girls and women the world over.&nbsp; Though the "Girl Power" fabulousness of the Spice Girls ultimately faded away as so often happens with pop groups, Victoria Beckham managed to launch an appreciable solo career.&nbsp; Four UK Top 10s proved her popularity separate from the Spice Girls, and helped her create an identity of her own.&nbsp; However, it proved to be in the world of fashion that "Posh Spice" has been able to have the most lasting influence.&nbsp; Her clothing choices were always debated ad nauseum in the British press, so it only seemed natural for her to parlay this fascination with her personal style into a career.&nbsp; She has designed her own denim line, a line of jeans for Rock & Republic, a line of sunglasses, a perfume, and a line of handbags and jewelry.&nbsp; She regularly appears in lifestyle magazines wearing the latest designer rags, and has penned a bestselling fashion guide.&nbsp; She has also served as a judge on multiple fashion-related reality shows, including "Project Runway" and "Germany's Next Top Model".&nbsp; She is also famous for being the wife of professional football player David Beckham. They began dating in 1997 and married in 1999.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-184106 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Victoria-Beckham.jpg alt width=594 height=513 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-184106 class=wp-caption-text>Rob Kim/Getty Images</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Victoria Caroline Adams was born on April 17, 1974, in Essex, England.
