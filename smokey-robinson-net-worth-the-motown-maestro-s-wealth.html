Back then, he was an integral part of the vocal group, which saw great success and fame throughout the Motown era.</p><p>When he finally left the group, Robinson pursued a successful solo career. He was also the vice president of Motown Records, and in 1987, Smokey was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p><p>Smokey has amassed this net worth due to his work and contribution to the music industry. He’s been active in the music industry for almost 50 years, earning over $160 million just from music alone.</p><p>Smokey gets almost $ 5 million every year from the royalties of the music he created throughout these years and his contribution to the music industry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=investment-in-real-estate></span>Investment in Real Estate<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Robinson sold his Encino, Los Angeles estate for $2.3 million in 2002. This luxurious was built in 1912, with unique features of 10,600 square feet of living space and an 800-square-foot private deck.</p><p>The property sits on a massive 1.5 acres of land, which includes luxurious, English-style gardens. The iconic mansion changed hands in 2017 when he sold it for $8.3 million.</p><p>In 2014, Smokey sold another Californian mansion for $7.99 million. This second property is in the affluent Chatsworth neighborhood of Los Angeles, where several other celebrities live.</p><p>The 9,075-square-foot property features a separate 2,000-square-foot guest house. In 2005, Smokey listed the residence for $10.5 million but re-listed it again for $10 million in 2007 after finding a buyer difficult. In 2014, the $7.99 million price represents a heavy discount.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=music-licensing-deal></span>Music Licensing Deal<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2018, Smokey Robinson, at the Senate House, called for the passage of music licensing legislation to extend copyright protection to sound recordings made before 1972. He said This issue was “a livelihood thing” for many older artists who no longer perform.</p><p>He told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday, “It is not just about music, it is about lives. They could really use that money.”</p><p>Smokey was the latest music legend to visit Capitol Hill in order to urge the passage of the Music Modernization Act. This is a set of changes in the law that is designed to streamline music licensing and also close a loophole in copyright law.</p><p>Congress extended copyright protection to sound recordings in the early 1970s, but it became effective as of Feb. 15, 1972.</p><p>The Motown legend will go to a go-go after he signed a deal with indie music publisher Primary Wave. This allows Primary Wave to exploit his name, likeness, and legendary songs.</p><p>Smokey’s music rights had previously been affected during a battle with his ex-wife, Claudette, who claimed she was owed a 50 percent stake in all the assets in 2014. But that case was soon settled.</p><p>The 76-year-old singer, the leader of Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, only recently won the ability to reaffirm complete and utter ownership over his pre-1976 songs through the Copyright Act.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=winery></span>Winery<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2017, Smokey decided to bring his passion for his music into the wine business, which immediately garnered impressive positive feedback and love.</p><p>In August 2018, Smokey Robinson Wines released its “Artist Song Series Brand.” A brand that produces four wines from Santa Barbara, CA.&nbsp; These beautiful wines, proudly boasting the names of some of Smokey’s most famous hit songs, include the “My Girl” Chardonnay, the “Being with You” Pinot Noir, the&nbsp;“Second That Emotion” Cabernet and the “Crusin” Bordeaux Blend.</p><p>A Smokey Robinson Cabernet Sauvignon glass greets you with a strong, spicy bouquet aroma. The aroma is backed by a flavor so smooth that it tastes and is as sweet as the vocals in his hit song, “Cruisin’,” This comes without the expected tang of the normal dry red wine.</p><p>The wine is made from the 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon grapes blended by Enginehouse 25 Wines. Smokey keeps his unfiltered red wine in oak barrels to give it a unique jammy taste.</p><p>Smokey Robinson Wines are available for purchase online at&nbsp;www.SmokeyRobinsonWines.com.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=awards-and-accolades></span>Awards and Accolades<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Smokey has achieved several awards since he began The Miracles.

In 1955, he formed the first group, The Five Chimes, with his childhood friend Ronald White and classmate Pete Moore.</p><p>Two years later, the trio renamed the group to the Matadors and signed in Bobby Rogers. He included another member, Emerson ‘Sonny’ Rogers, Bobby Rogers’ cousin, who he replaced with his sister, Claudette Rogers.</p><p>He included Marv Tarplin as the group’s guitarist, who joined them sometime in 1958.

The album included the Miracles tribute song, “Sweet Harmony,” and the then-hit ballad “Baby Come Close.”</p><p>Smokey’s second album, Pure Smokey, was dropped in 1974, but the album failed to produce the intended hits. Smokey struggled to compete with his former collaborators like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=smokey-robinsons-personal-life></span>Smokey Robinson’s Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Robinson married Claudette Rogers in 1959.
