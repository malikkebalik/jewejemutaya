Interestingly, the property's official listing doesn't shy away from Wilson's most famous TV character, opening with the following attention-grabber: "The inspiration for TV's 'Dwight's Beet Farm' may have been this celebrity owned writer's & artist's oasis in old Agoura." The house boasts three bedrooms and three baths, plus another three "flex rooms" that can be adapted to suit whatever purpose the new owner wishes. Out back there's a detached writer's office and "Man Cave/She-Shed" nestled in the trees.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZL%2Bitc2nZLChnKi8r3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nintendo-of-america-president-reggie-fils-aime-on-the-switch.html><span>←</span><span>Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime On the Switch</span></a>
