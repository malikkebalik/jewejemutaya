Kandi knows this story is all about Todd and the will. Her mom doesn’t trust Todd but Kandi isn’t letting that affect her.</p><p>Nene is trying to find clothes for the baby shower. She gets a call from Wendy that Kenya has been talking about her. Wendy tells Nene to take the high road and not retaliate. She agrees.</p><p>Kandi and Todd are on a movie set where they will be throwing the baby shower. Later, Nene goes to visit Porsha and the baby. Nene tells her all about Kenya talking about her. They talk about how she loves drama. That is just how Kenya is. They talk about how Kenya told everyone that Shamea called her when her water broke. But that was a lie. They think she is crazy.</p><p>Porsha just doesn’t want any problems with Kenya. Meanwhile, Kandi is talking to Kaela about being independent. At some point, she has to move out. They head to the baby shower.</p><p>At the shower, they all walk the red carpet which is actually pink and have their pictures taken. Everyone is having a good time, eating and talking. They all help Kenya and Nene can get along.</p><p>The surrogate mother for Kandi and Todd arrive. A little later, Todd and Kandi argue about her mom who hasn’t shown up. Kandi knows it is because Todd didn’t say hello to her earlier.</p><p>Kandi tells Sam that a hollow is quick and easy and free. They go out at some more and then go their separate ways to say hello to their party guests. Kandi is excited for the baby but feels very weird that she’s not actually pregnant. This is a different experience for her.</p><p>Kandi tells all the girls about how her mom isn’t going to show up tonight. They can’t believe it. She tells them that Todd made her mom angry.</p><p>The games begin. The men are brought up on stage where they wear pregnancy bellies and do the limbo. Everybody gets a kick out of it laughing. Nene runs into Kenya several times but chooses to ignore her. Kenya decides to read headlines from news reports off her phone to a group of them. The two start to argue, Kandi tries to change the subject and get them to pay attention to the party. But the feud continues on even when Kandi takes the stage. It finally dies off when Kandi and Todd talk to introduce their surrogate. Todd then apologizes to Kandi for not saying hello to her mother.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWlnpJ2ybr7EmqNmoJ%2BqwKbDyK%2BcrGWfm3qiwMuapa2ZXae1sK2Mn6CnmZyaerOxwpqnZmhkYn56eZFpZKydkai8r3mQa2SeqJmovKWxjGtpZpldqMGivoyiqmaan6e7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-the-eiffel-tower-2024.html><span>←</span><span>What happened to the Eiffel Tower 2024?</span></a>
