One shows what you might call the Iron Family – Iron Man, Rescue, War Machine and Spider-Man – blasting through the sky, while another captures a moving kiss between Tony and Pepper on the battlefield. The most satisfying, though, has to be the concept art of Smart Hulk finally getting the better of the Mad Titan with a mean right hook.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/avengers-endgame-concept-art-hulk-thanos.jpg><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>We know that there was a heck of a lot of material that never made it into the finished cut of&nbsp;Endgame, ranging from abandoned subplots that never got past the script stage – <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarlet Witch and Rocket road trip</a>, anyone? – to key sequences that were ultimately removed due to test screening reactions – <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katherine Langford’s cameo</a> as a teenage Morgan Stark.
