Recommended Videos The sixth episode of HBO’s The Last of Us, entitled “Kin,” does not differ much from the previous episodes in that it still made us reach for the tissues. It finally paid off the journey we have been on all season, with Joel (Pedro Pascal) finally finding his brother Tommy (Gabriel Luna). In fact, it turns out that Joel was worried about his brother for nothing, as Tommy is thriving in his new commune in Jackson, Wyoming."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The commune is located near a dam and it is quite large, complete with Christmas trees, sheep, and a movie theater. After Ellie (Bella Ramsey) gets settled in and has a fresh haircut, she joins other members of the community and watches a movie.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>The show only cuts to the film quickly, so you might be wondering what exactly they were watching.

Tony sublets the apartment to his friend Elliot, and after moving in and spending time with Marsha the pair fall in love. He also meets her daughter Lucy, and she likes him too, although she’s afraid of her mother getting hurt again.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>It’s a fun parallel between the surrogate father and daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie, compared to the one between Elliot and Lucy. Richard Dreyfuss was nominated for and won the 1977 Academy Award for Best Actor, making him the youngest actor to win the award at the time. You can rent or buy The Goodbye Girl on the Google Play Store, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime Video.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=78 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=false>New episodes of HBO’s The Last of Us drop on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HBO Max</a> on Sunday nights.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKanpp6ybsPEq5xmrJiaerOx0qKbnqakqHqwsoytn55lo5rBtbjEppynrF2srrWvx6KloGWZo3qprs6sZK2glWK5or%2FTZqafZaWofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happens-if-superheat-is-too-high.html><span>←</span><span>What happens if superheat is too high?</span></a>
