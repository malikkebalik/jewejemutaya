In 2014, they had a child. Three years later, they permanently separated in 2017. While they were raising their child together, the couple spoke out against photographers taking pictures of children without expressed permission, especially the children of celebrities. This is known as the "No Kids Policy."</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2017, Bilson made a concerted effort to start fresh after her split with Hayden Christensen by purchasing a new home in Pasadena. She had previously been living in a Sherman Oaks property with her former fiancee. The couple purchased the property in 2012 for $2.7, and they sold it for $3.8 million following their split in 2017.</p><p>Bilson then paid $2.25 million for her new property in Pasadena, which sits just above the Rose Bowl. Originally designed in the 1950s by a well-known architect, the home features 3,700 square feet of living space. The outdoor space was also painstakingly designed by a renowned landscape architect.</p><p>Although the interior is certainly spacious and modern, the outdoor area is what makes this property truly unique. A one-of-a-kind swimming pool and a dry dock stream lie in the middle of a large lawn. There's also an expansive porch overlooking the mountain, the valleys, and the city of Los Angeles in the distance.</p><p>According to reports, this Pasadena property was previously owned by Walter Ralphs Jr., the heir to the Ralphs grocery store franchise. In 2014, the house was made a local landmark because of its historical significance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZL%2Bir8eeo2aamaHAsLqMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-the-dark-knight-paved-the-way-for-oppenheimer-s-imax-dominance.html><span>←</span><span>How The Dark Knight paved the way for Oppenheimers IMAX dominance</span></a>
