<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>These Are The 10 Highest Paid YouTube Stars of 2018</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It is hard to believe that YouTube has only been around for 13 years. Since YouTube launched way back in 2005, it has become a factory for creating internet stars and millionaires – many of whom are not legally old enough to buy or consume an alcoholic beverage. The biggest YouTube celebrities have become masters at attracting an audience to monetize their sponsored videos and advertising. Along the way, these internet stars make a name for themselves offline too, often publishing books, or getting roles in television shows or deals from Netflix, Disney, or YouTube Red. Brand partnerships and clothing lines have also become a part of the biggest YouTube personalities' revenue streams.</p><p>Ask any kid or tween or 20 something and they can tell you who the biggest YouTube stars are. But what they may not understand is just how much money their favorite YouTubers are making. Of the top 10 highest paid YouTube stars, the lowest paid – 23-year-old Logan Paul – made $14.5 million. A dude that goes by <a href=# title="Markiplier Net Worth">Markiplier</a> made $17.5 million. His real name is Mark Fischbach and he is a native of Hawaii. He launched his YouTube channel in 2012 while he was in school in Cincinnati as a biomedical engineering student and going through a rough time. He has broken up with his girlfriend, been laid off from his job, and had an adrenal gland tumor that had to be removed by surgeons. He didn't feel like he had any control over his life, so he started recording audio segments as practice for a career in voice overs, but the now 29-year-old found an audience through clips in which he played video games while providing witty running commentary on the game. Today, he has 22.4 million YouTube subscribers and 10 billion views of his videos. So basically, he makes $17.5 million for playing video games. This fall, Fischbach co-founded an athleisure line called Cloak with fellow YouTuber Sean McLoughlin, aka "<a href=# title="Jacksepticeye Net Worth">Jacksepticeye</a>." Jacksepticeye came in 8th&nbsp;on this year's list with $16 million.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-273435 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-494848194.jpg alt width=900 height=587 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-273435 class=wp-caption-text>John Lamparski/Getty Images</p><p>Yeah, OK.
