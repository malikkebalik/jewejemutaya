I’d even figure out how to make doing laundry or talking on the phone use more calories.”</p><p>[From <a href=#>USA Today</a>]</p><p>Since then Jamie-Lynn has done a lot of hard work to get healthy and stay in recovery, and has become a spokesperson for the National Eating Disorder Association.</p><p>“It’s hard for me to even recognize who I was,” the former Sopranos actress, 26, tells PEOPLE. “My reality was so warped. … I knew I had a problem and wanted to get better, but I was not able to let go of my habit.” She recalls one moment in particular – a meal with her family, when her father begged her to have some cake. “I remember rationalizing that if I had that one piece of dessert, the next morning I would wake up and weigh 400 pounds,” she says. “It sounds so wild, but for me it was true.”</p><p>[From <a href=#>People</a>]</p><p>To stay in recovery, Jamie-Lyn says she tries to eat healthfully, but makes sure she doesn’t let herself make any food regulations. She noted that she used to know ” every calorie that entered my body, and I tried to measure every calorie that I could burn. So for me, any sort of regimen, any sort of ritual or rule when it comes to dieting or exercising, is bad for me.” Stars like Jamie-Lynn Sigler and Jennifer Love Hewitt are doing a great job of drawing attention to the negative effects women (and men) can suffer as a result of poor body image. Good for them for speaking up and trying to live healthier lives.</p><p><b>Picture note by Celebitchy</b>: Jamie-Lynn Sigler is shown at the Glamour Women of the Year Awards on 11/5/07, thanks to PRPhotos.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.photobucket.com/albums/s218/celebitchy/decembera/th_sigler1.jpg hspace=2 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.photobucket.com/albums/s218/celebitchy/decembera/th_sigler2.jpg hspace=2 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.photobucket.com/albums/s218/celebitchy/decembera/th_sigler3.jpg hspace=2 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcHFlaXyrrcyinGakqaO7oL%2FIoKOeqo%2BdvK%2B70Z6bmJ6fp6ymrdOipaCXlJ7AsL7DnqmYr5%2BnuHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hire-steve-aoki-for-a-corporate-event-or-performance-booking.html><span>←</span><span>Hire Steve Aoki for a Corporate Event or Performance Booking.</span></a>
